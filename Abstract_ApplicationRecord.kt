In Rails, an abstract class is a class that is meant to be inherited by other classes, 
but not instantiated directly. It serves as a base class for other classes to share common functionality,
but it cannot be used to create objects on its own.

In the context of Rails models, the ApplicationRecord class is an example of an abstract class. 
It is defined as the base class for all models in Rails applications and inherits from ActiveRecord::Base. 
By convention, all other model classes in Rails inherit from ApplicationRecord.

Heres an example of how ApplicationRecord is defined in Rails:


class ApplicationRecord < ActiveRecord::Base
  self.abstract_class = true
end
By setting self.abstract_class = true, Rails marks ApplicationRecord as an abstract class. 
This means that you cannot directly instantiate ApplicationRecord or use it to create database records.
Instead, you inherit from it to create concrete model classes.

For instance, consider a User model that inherits from ApplicationRecord:


class User < ApplicationRecord
  # Model-specific code and functionality
end
In this example, the User model inherits from ApplicationRecord. 
It gains all the features and behavior provided by ActiveRecord::Base and ApplicationRecord. 
You can define model-specific code, validations, associations, and other functionality within the User class.

To create instances of the User model, you can use the new method:


user = User.new
The new method creates a new instance of the User model, which can then be populated with data and saved 
to the database using save, create, or other ActiveRecord methods.

In summary, abstract classes like ApplicationRecord in Rails serve as base classes for models, 
providing common functionality and acting as a blueprint for concrete model classes.
You cannot directly instantiate abstract classes; instead, you inherit from them to create usable model classes
that can be instantiated and used to interact with the database.







MORE EXPLANTION
*******************************************************************************************************************

in the above contxt, my rails applicaion uses this,

class ApplicationRecord < ActiveRecord::Base
  primary_abstract_class
end

Is this still an abstsrct class, even without "self.abstract_class = true" and how






---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the context you provided, where the ApplicationRecord class inherits from ActiveRecord::Base without
explicitly setting self.abstract_class = true,
the class is not considered an abstract class in Rails.

In Rails, the self.abstract_class = true statement is used to explicitly mark a class as abstract,
indicating that it should not be directly instantiated. By default, when creating a new Rails application,
the ApplicationRecord class does not have self.abstract_class = true explicitly set.

Therefore, without self.abstract_class = true, the ApplicationRecord class is not considered an abstract class in Rails.
It behaves like a regular class and can be instantiated directly if desired.

For example, you can instantiate ApplicationRecord and create records using it:

ruby
Copy code
record = ApplicationRecord.new
record.save
However, its important to note that in most Rails applications, 
its uncommon to directly instantiate ApplicationRecord or create records using it.
Instead, it serves as a base class for other models in the application.

By convention, when creating new models in Rails, you inherit from ApplicationRecord and use the derived 
model class to instantiate objects and interact with the database. This practice promotes code organization,
consistency, and adheres to the principles of object-oriented programming and the ActiveRecord pattern.

To summarize, without self.abstract_class = true, the ApplicationRecord class is not considered an abstract class in Rails.
It can be directly instantiated, but it is typically used as a base class for other models within the application.
