For a small to medium-sized application like a cooking app where users can share recipes, videos of cooking, pictures of food, and ingredients, you dont necessarily need a heavy-duty message broker like Kafka. Instead, you can consider using a more lightweight message broker that's easy to set up and manage. Two popular choices for such applications are RabbitMQ and Redis.

1. **RabbitMQ**:
   - **Use Case**: RabbitMQ is a robust message broker suitable for a wide range of applications, including small to medium-sized ones. It's particularly well-suited for tasks like distributing messages, queuing tasks, and handling asynchronous communication.
   - **Features**:
     - Reliability: RabbitMQ is known for its reliability and durability.
     - Support for various messaging patterns, including publish/subscribe and request/reply.
     - Easy-to-use management interface.
     - A rich ecosystem of client libraries for various programming languages, including Ruby for your Rails application.
   - **Ease of Use**: RabbitMQ is relatively easy to set up and configure.
   
2. **Redis**:
   - **Use Case**: Redis is an in-memory data store, but it can also be used as a lightweight message broker for simple communication scenarios. It's ideal for applications that need low-latency and high-throughput data access.
   - **Features**:
     - Very high performance due to in-memory storage.
     - Publish/subscribe functionality for simple message broadcasting.
     - Support for data structures that can be useful in a variety of application scenarios.
     - Redis Streams for handling event streams.
   - **Ease of Use**: Redis is straightforward to set up, and its simplicity can be an advantage for smaller applications.

**Recommendation**:
For a small to medium-sized cooking app, both RabbitMQ and Redis are suitable options. You might choose RabbitMQ if you anticipate a need for more complex messaging patterns and durability. On the other hand, if your application primarily requires message broadcasting and low-latency access to data, Redis can be a good choice.

In addition to your message broker, consider the overall architecture and data storage needs of your application. For example, you might use a relational database like PostgreSQL or MySQL for recipe storage and user data. Ultimately, your choice should align with the specific requirements and future scalability plans of your cooking app.
