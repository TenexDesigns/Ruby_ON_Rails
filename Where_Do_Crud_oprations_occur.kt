In Rails, CRUD operations typically occur within the controllers.
The controllers are responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests, extracting parameters,
interacting with the models to fetch or manipulate data, and coordinating the flow of data between the models and the views.

Each CRUD operation is typically mapped to a specific action within the controller:

Create (C): The creation of a new record typically happens in the create action of the controller. 
This action is responsible for instantiating a new instance of the model, 
populating it with data from the request parameters, and saving it to the database.

Read (R): Reading or retrieving records is typically done in the index and show actions of the controller.
The index action fetches a collection of records, while the show action retrieves a specific record by its identifier.

Update (U): Updating existing records is typically performed in the update action of the controller.
This action retrieves the desired record, updates its attributes based on the request parameters,
and saves the changes to the database.

Delete (D): Deleting records is typically done in the destroy action of the controller.
This action retrieves the record to be deleted and removes it from the database.

For example, lets consider a ProjectsController:


class ProjectsController < ApplicationController
  # ...

  def create
    @project = Project.new(project_params)
    if @project.save
      # Handle successful creation
    else
      # Handle validation errors
    end
  end

  def index
    @projects = Project.all
    # ...
  end

  def show
    @project = Project.find(params[:id])
    # ...
  end

  def update
    @project = Project.find(params[:id])
    if @project.update(project_params)
      # Handle successful update
    else
      # Handle validation errors
    end
  end

  def destroy
    @project = Project.find(params[:id])
    @project.destroy
    # ...
  end

  # ...

  private

  def project_params
    params.require(:project).permit(:name, :description, :other_attributes)
  end
end
In the above example, the CRUD operations are distributed across the different actions of the ProjectsController.
The create action handles the creation of a new project, the index action retrieves all projects, 
the show action retrieves a specific project, the update action updates a project, and the destroy action deletes a project.

Its worth noting that while the controllers handle the coordination of CRUD operations, 
the actual data manipulation and validation typically occur within the models using ActiveRecord methods and validations.
The controllers act as intermediaries between the models and the views,
ensuring proper data flow and handling the appropriate HTTP requests.

In the provided code snippet:

class ProjectsController < ApplicationController
  def new
    @project = Project.new
  end
end

The new action within the ProjectsController is responsible for instantiating a new Project object
and assigning it to the @project instance variable.

The line @project = Project.new creates a new instance of the Project model and assigns it to the @project variable.
This is typically used when you want to display a form for creating a new project.

By assigning the @project instance variable, it becomes accessible within the associated view,
allowing you to build a form that binds to the attributes of the Project model.

For example, if you have a new.html.erb view associated with the new action,
you can use the @project variable to create a form for creating a new project:


<!-- app/views/projects/new.html.erb -->
<h1>New Project</h1>

<%= form_for(@project) do |f| %>
  <div>
    <%= f.label :name %>
    <%= f.text_field :name %>
  </div>

  <div>
    <%= f.label :description %>
    <%= f.text_area :description %>
  </div>

  <%= f.submit "Create Project" %>
<% end %>
  
  
In the above example, the form_for helper method is used to generate an HTML form that corresponds to the @project object.
The form fields are bound to the attributes of the Project model (:name and :description), allowing users to input the desired values.

When the form is submitted, it will trigger the corresponding create action within the controller to persist the 
new project to the database. The @project instance variable, which was initially set to a new Project object,
will now contain the data entered by the user.

In Rails, CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) occur in the model layer.
The model layer is responsible for defining the schema of the corresponding database tables and 
for performing CRUD operations on the data. Developers can use Active Record,
a feature of Rails, to write database queries and perform CRUD operations on the database.
Active Record provides a simple API for interacting with the database without having to write SQL directly. [0] [6] [7] [8] [11]

Rails has a simple way of implementing RESTful routing, which is a way to make navigating web applications easier. 
RESTful routing gives developers a simple and consistent design pattern for implementing CRUD actions in their routes.
Developers can use resourceful routes in their projects, which are based on the HTTP verbs and the URL pattern. 
Rails provides a scaffold command to make creating CRUD operations easier. [6] [8] [11]

In summary, CRUD operations occur in the model layer in Rails, and developers can use Active Record 
to interact with the database and perform CRUD operations. RESTful routing provides a simple and consistent 
design pattern for implementing CRUD actions in routes, and Rails provides a scaffold command to make creating CRUD operations easier.
