The `created_at` and `updated_at` columns in Rails are automatically created by the framework for timestamping when a record is created and updated. These columns are part of Rails' conventions and are often considered useful for tracking record changes and history. However, if you don't need them or find them inconvenient for your specific use case, you have a few options:

**1. Remove Them in a Migration:**

If you want to remove the `created_at` and `updated_at` columns from a specific table, you can create a new migration to remove them. Here's an example of how you can do it:

```bash
rails generate migration RemoveTimestampsFromProjects
```

This will generate a new migration file. In the migration file, you can remove the columns like this:

```ruby
class RemoveTimestampsFromProjects < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.1]
  def change
    remove_column :projects, :created_at
    remove_column :projects, :updated_at
  end
end
```

After creating the migration, you can run it to remove the columns from the `projects` table:

```bash
rails db:migrate
```

**2. Exclude Timestamps in the Model:**

If you don't want to use timestamps in a specific model, you can exclude them by adding the following line to the model:

```ruby
class Project < ApplicationRecord
  self.record_timestamps = false
end
```

This will prevent timestamps from being updated when records are created or updated for the `Project` model.

**3. Disable Timestamps Globally:**

If you want to disable the automatic timestamping behavior for all models in your application, you can do so in your application configuration (`config/application.rb`). Add the following line:

```ruby
config.active_record.record_timestamps = false
```

This will disable the automatic timestamping behavior for all models in your Rails application.

Keep in mind that the `created_at` and `updated_at` columns are beneficial for many applications as they help in tracking record changes and history. Removing them should be a deliberate decision based on your specific requirements. If you later decide that you want to reintroduce them, you can create a migration to add them back.
