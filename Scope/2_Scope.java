A scope in Rails is a named query that you can define on a model. Scopes can be used to filter, sort, and select data from the database. Scopes can be chained together to create complex queries.

Scopes are defined using the `scope` method. The `scope` method takes two arguments: the name of the scope and a block of code. The block of code defines the query that will be executed when the scope is called.

**Example**

The following example shows how to define a scope on the `Post` model:

```ruby
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  scope :published, -> { where(published: true) }
end
```

This scope will return all of the posts that have been published.

**Where are scopes used in Rails?**

Scopes can be used in a variety of places in Rails applications, including:

* Controllers: Scopes can be used to filter the data that is returned from controller actions.
* Views: Scopes can be used to filter the data that is displayed in views.
* Models: Scopes can be used to filter the data that is returned from model relationships.

**What do scopes do in Rails?**

Scopes do two things:

* They filter the data that is returned from a database query.
* They return a new ActiveRecord::Relation object.

This means that scopes can be chained together to create complex queries.

**Example**

The following example shows how to chain two scopes together to filter the data that is returned:

```ruby
posts = Post.published.recent
```

This will return all of the published posts that have been created in the last 24 hours.

**Conclusion**

Scopes are a powerful tool for filtering, sorting, and selecting data from the database. By using scopes, you can improve the quality and maintainability of your Rails code.
