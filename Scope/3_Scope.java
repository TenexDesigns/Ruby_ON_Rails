In Ruby on Rails, a scope is a way to define a query that can be reused throughout your application. It allows you to encapsulate commonly used query conditions into a named scope, making your code more readable and maintainable.

Scopes are defined within the model class using the `scope` method. Here's an example:

```ruby
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  scope :published, -> { where(published: true) }
end
```

In this example, the `published` scope is defined for the `Post` model. It uses a lambda (`->`) to define the query condition, which selects posts where the `published` attribute is `true`.

Once a scope is defined, you can use it in your queries like any other method. For example:

```ruby
published_posts = Post.published
```

This will return a collection of posts that meet the conditions defined in the `published` scope.

Scopes can also accept arguments to make them more flexible. For example:

```ruby
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  scope :published_before, ->(date) { where("published_at < ?", date) }
end
```

In this example, the `published_before` scope takes a `date` argument and selects posts that were published before the specified date.

You can chain multiple scopes together to create more complex queries. For example:

```ruby
recent_published_posts = Post.published.published_before(Date.today)
```

This will return posts that are both published and were published before today.

Scopes are commonly used to define reusable query conditions, such as filtering by status, date, or any other attribute. They help to keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and make it easier to maintain and understand.
