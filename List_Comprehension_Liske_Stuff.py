<% @projects.each do | project | %>

    <P><%= project.title%></P>
    <p><%= "#{project.percent_complete}"  if project.percent_complete != nil   %></p>







<% end %>









The line of code <p><%= "#{project.percent_complete}" if project.percent_complete != nil %></p> in Ruby on Rails is a conditional
statement that displays the value of project.percent_complete within a paragraph (<p> tag) if project.percent_complete 
is not equal to nil.

Lets break down the code:

<p>: This is an HTML paragraph tag that defines a paragraph.
<%= ... %>: This is an ERB (Embedded Ruby) tag used in Ruby on Rails to embed Ruby code within an HTML template and 
  output the result of the code to the page.
"#{project.percent_complete}": This is Ruby string interpolation used to convert the value of project.percent_complete to a string.
if project.percent_complete != nil: This is a conditional statement that checks if project.percent_complete is not
  equal to nil. In other words, it checks if the percent_complete attribute of the project object has a value.
%>: This closes the ERB tag.
  
If project.percent_complete is not nil, the value of project.percent_complete will be
interpolated into the string and displayed within the paragraph. 
If project.percent_complete is nil, nothing will be displayed within the paragraph.

This code snippet is typically used when iterating over a collection of projects (@projects) and displaying their titles and,
if available, the percentage of completion.









**********************************************************************************************************
No, the string interpolation ("#{project.percent_complete}") in the given code is not necessary for the code to work correctly.
It is used to convert the value of project.percent_complete to a string explicitly.

In Ruby on Rails ERB templates, when you use <%= ... %>, the expression inside the tags is automatically converted to
a string before being output to the HTML page.
So, if project.percent_complete is a numeric value, it will be automatically converted to a string without explicitly
using string interpolation.

Therefore, the line <p><%= project.percent_complete if project.percent_complete != nil %></p> without the string
interpolation would work just fine. It would output the value of project.percent_complete as a string if it
is not nil and would not display anything if it is nil.
