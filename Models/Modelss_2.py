Sure, here is an explanation of models in Rails with code samples:

What are models in Rails?
Models are the core of any Rails application. They represent the data and business logic of your application.
Models are responsible for storing, retrieving, and manipulating data in the database. 
They also have validation methods that ensure that the data is valid before it is saved to the database.

What happens inside models?
Models are Ruby classes that inherit from Active Record::Base. 
    Active Record is an object-relational mapper (ORM) that provides a layer of abstraction between your application
    and the database. This means that you dont have to worry about the details of how the database works.
    You can just focus on writing code that represents your domain model.

Inside a model, you will typically find methods for:

Storing and retrieving data from the database
Validating data before it is saved to the database
Performing business logic operations on data
What does ApplicationRecord do?
ApplicationRecord is a base class that all other models inherit from.
It provides a number of methods that are common to all models, such as:

Methods for creating, finding, updating, and deleting records
Methods for validating data
Methods for performing business logic operations
Why does ApplicationRecord inherit from ActiveRecord::Base?
ActiveRecord::Base is the base class for all Active Record models.
    It provides the core functionality that all Active Record models need, such as:

Methods for connecting to the database
Methods for querying the database
Methods for inserting, updating, and deleting records
What are naming conventions for models?
Models should be named in singular form.
For example, a model for representing users should be called User.

What is the relationship between model classes and database tables?
Each model class corresponds to a database table.
The name of the model class should be the same as the name of the database table.

Are models responsible for CRUD operations?
Yes, models are responsible for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
They provide methods for performing these operations on data in the database.

What are validations done in models?
Validations are methods that are used to ensure that data is valid before it is saved to the database. 
For example, you might have a validation method that ensures that the name of a user is not blank.

What are callbacks in models?
Callbacks are methods that are called before or after an event occurs. 
For example, you might have a callback method that is called before a record is saved to the database.

What is object lifecycle in this context?
The object lifecycle in the context of Rails models is the process of creating, using, and destroying objects. 
The object lifecycle begins when an object is created. The object is then used to perform some operation.
Finally, the object is destroyed.

What are migrations in this context?
Migrations are Ruby files that are used to create, modify, and delete database tables.
Migrations are run using the rake db:migrate command.

How can migrations be done in models?
Migrations can be done in models by using the create_table, add_column, and change_column methods. 
For example, the following code creates a table called users:

Code snippet
def up
  create_table :users do |t|
    t.string :name
    t.string :email
  end
end

def down
  drop_table :users
end
Use code with caution. Learn more
This code will create a table called users with two columns: name and email.

I hope this explanation of models in Rails is helpful.
