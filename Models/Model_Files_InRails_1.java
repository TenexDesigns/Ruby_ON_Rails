  In Ruby on Rails, model files play a crucial role in defining the structure, behavior,
  and logic of your applications data. They are responsible for handling interactions with the database, 
  defining relationships between different models, and encapsulating business logic.

Creating Custom Model Files:
To create a custom model file in Rails, you can generate a new model using the Rails generator. 
For example, to create a model called "User," you can run the following command in your terminal:


rails generate model User
This will generate a user.rb file in the app/models directory. You can then open this file and define your custom model:


class User < ApplicationRecord
  # Custom code and configuration goes here
end
Antipatterns to Avoid in Model Files:

Fat Models: Avoid putting too much logic in your models. Its better to keep them focused on database
  interactions and relationships. Move complex business logic to other classes like service objects or separate modules.

Overuse of Callbacks: While callbacks can be useful, excessive use can lead to code that is difficult to reason about and maintain.
  Be cautious with their usage and consider extracting complex logic into separate methods.

Lack of Validations: Neglecting to include appropriate validations can lead to inconsistent or invalid data in your database.
  Always validate your models to ensure data integrity.

Model File Best Practices:

Add Custom Scopes: Scopes allow you to define commonly used query conditions in your models. 
  They make it easier to reuse query logic and keep your code DRY (Dont Repeat Yourself). For example:

class User < ApplicationRecord
  scope :active, -> { where(active: true) }
end
Add Defaults: Set default values for model attributes to provide sensible defaults and simplify your code.
                                                                   
 You can use the default option in your models migration or the default attribute in the model itself. For example:

class User < ApplicationRecord
  attribute :role, :string, default: 'user'
end
Integrate Validations: Rails provides a rich set of validation helpers to ensure data consistency.
 Use these validators to enforce data integrity. For example:

class User < ApplicationRecord
  validates :email, presence: true, format: { with: URI::MailTo::EMAIL_REGEXP }
end
Integrate Callbacks: Callbacks allow you to execute code at specific points in the lifecycle of your models, 
  such as before saving or after creating. Use callbacks sparingly and with caution, as they can make code harder 
  to understand and maintain.

Integrate Database Relationships: Rails provides convenient methods for defining relationships between models, 
  such as has_many, belongs_to, and has_and_belongs_to_many. Use these methods to establish associations and define 
  the relationships between your models.


class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :posts
end

class Post < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
end
By following these best practices, you can create clean, maintainable, and robust model files in your Rails applications.

  Sure. Here are some details about model files in Rails:

Model files are used to define the data model for your Rails application. They contain classes that represent the tables
in your database.
The purpose of Rails is to make it easy to create web applications. It provides a lot of features that make development 
faster and easier, including model files.
Creating custom model files is a way to add custom functionality to your Rails application. You can use custom model files
to define custom scopes, add defaults, integrate validations, integrate callbacks, and integrate database relationships.
Model files antipatterns to avoid in Rails include:
Not using model validations
Not using strong parameters
Not using helper methods
Not using partials
Not using the asset pipeline
Model files best practices to adhere to in Rails include:
Use model validations
Use strong parameters
Use helper methods
Use partials
Use the asset pipeline
Here are some code samples that show how to add custom scopes, add defaults, integrate validations, integrate callbacks, 
and integrate database relationships in model files:

Ruby
# Add custom scopes
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  scope :active, -> { where(active: true) }
end

# Add defaults
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  default_scope { order(created_at: :desc) }
end

# Integrate validations
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates :name, presence: true
  validates :price, numericality: { greater_than: 0 }
end

# Integrate callbacks
class Order < ActiveRecord::Base
  before_save :set_total_price

  def set_total_price
    self.total_price = line_items.map(&:total_price).sum
  end
end

# Integrate database relationships
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :posts
  has_many :comments, through: :posts
end
