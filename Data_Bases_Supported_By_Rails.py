Rails supports a wide range of databases, including:

SQLite
MySQL
PostgreSQL
Oracle
Microsoft SQL Server
Amazon Aurora
Google Cloud SQL
IBM Cloud SQL
Rails also supports a number of NoSQL databases, including:

MongoDB
Redis
Elasticsearch
Firebase
When choosing a database for your Rails application, you should consider the following factors:

The size and complexity of your application
The amount of data you need to store
The performance requirements of your application
Your budget
If you are unsure which database to choose, I recommend that you consult with a database expert.

Here are some additional details about the databases that Rails supports:

SQLite is a lightweight, in-memory database that is perfect for development and testing.
MySQL is a popular, open-source relational database that is a good choice for small to medium-sized applications.
PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database that is a good choice for medium to large-sized applications.
Oracle is a commercial relational database that is a good choice for large-scale applications.
Microsoft SQL Server is a commercial relational database that is a good choice for large-scale applications.
Amazon Aurora is a managed MySQL service that is a good choice for applications that need high availability and scalability.
Google Cloud SQL is a managed MySQL service that is a good choice for applications that need high availability and scalability.
IBM Cloud SQL is a managed MySQL service that is a good choice for applications that need high availability and scalability.
