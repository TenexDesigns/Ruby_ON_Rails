ActionController provides various HTTP authentication methods to secure your Rails application 
and restrict access to certain actions or controllers. These authentication methods allow you 
to authenticate users based on their credentials, such as username and password, or by using tokens or API keys.
Here are some commonly used HTTP authentication methods in ActionController:

Basic Authentication:
Basic authentication is a simple authentication scheme where the users credentials are sent in
the HTTP headers with each request. The server validates the credentials before allowing access 
to the requested resource. You can enable basic authentication by using the authenticate_or_request_with_http_basic 
method in your controller or a before_action filter. Heres an example:

ruby
Copy code
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  before_action :authenticate

  private

  def authenticate
    authenticate_or_request_with_http_basic do |username, password|
      # Validate the username and password
      User.authenticate(username, password)
    end
  end
end
In this example, the authenticate method is called as a before_action,
and it prompts the user for credentials using the basic authentication scheme.

Token-based Authentication:
Token-based authentication involves generating and using tokens to authenticate users. 
Instead of sending credentials with each request, the client includes a token in the request headers or as a query parameter. 
You can implement token-based authentication using Rails built-in token_authenticatable
module or popular authentication libraries like Devise or JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
Heres an example using the token_authenticatable module:

class User < ApplicationRecord
  devise :database_authenticatable, :token_authenticatable
end
With this setup, a token will be generated and stored in the authentication_token column of the users table.
The client can include this token in subsequent requests for authentication.

API Key Authentication:
API key authentication involves providing a unique API key with each request to authenticate the user.
The API key can be sent in the request headers or as a query parameter.
You can implement API key authentication by validating the provided API key in your controller or a before_action filter. 
Heres an example:


class ApiController < ApplicationController
  before_action :authenticate

  private

  def authenticate
    api_key = request.headers['X-API-Key'] || params[:api_key]
    # Validate the API key
    unless ApiKey.exists?(key: api_key)
      render json: { error: 'Invalid API key' }, status: :unauthorized
    end
  end
end

In this example, the authenticate method checks the provided API key in the request headers
or parameters and validates it against the stored API keys.

These are just a few examples of HTTP authentication methods available in ActionController. 
Depending on your applications requirements, you can choose the appropriate authentication
method or combine multiple methods to secure your applications endpoints and ensure only 
authorized users can access protected resources.
