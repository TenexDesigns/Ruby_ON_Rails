In Rails, models are typically generated using generators to streamline the development process and adhere to Rails conventions.
Generators are command-line tools that create the necessary files and directory structure for a specific component of a Rails
application.

When you generate a model using a generator, it creates the model file (<model_name>.rb) within the app/models directory. 
It also generates a corresponding migration file in the db/migrate directory to create the table associated with the model
in the database.

By using generators, you ensure consistency and follow Rails conventions, 
which can help maintain a clean and organized codebase. Generators automatically generate boilerplate code and file structures,
reducing the need for manual setup and repetitive tasks.

To generate a model, you can use the rails generate model command followed by the desired model name and its attributes. 
For example, to generate a User model with name and email attributes, you would run:


rails generate model User name:string email:string
This command would generate a User model file (user.rb) and a migration file that defines the necessary table 
structure for the users table.

After generating the model, you can make changes to it manually by editing the model file (app/models/<model_name>.rb). 
However, its generally recommended to use additional generators or migration commands for making changes to existing models.
For example, you can generate a migration to add a new column or modify an existing column in the database schema:


rails generate migration AddAgeToUsers age:integer
This command generates a migration file that adds an age column to the users table. 
Then, you can run the migration using rails db:migrate to apply the changes to the database.

By using generators and migrations, you ensure that the database schema and model files stay in sync, 
making it easier to manage and evolve your applications data structure over time.

Sure, here is an explanation of abstract classes in Rails, 
and why we cannot instantiate model classes, explained with code samples:

An abstract class in Rails is a class that cannot be instantiated.
It is used to provide a common interface for other classes to inherit from.
Abstract classes cannot be instantiated because they do not have a new method.

Here is an example of an abstract class in Rails:

Code snippet
class Animal
  def speak
    # Abstract method. Must be implemented by subclasses.
  end
end
Use code with caution. Learn more
This class cannot be instantiated because it does not have a new method.
However, it can be inherited from by other classes. For example:

Code snippet
class Dog < Animal
  def speak
    puts "Woof!"
  end
end

class Cat < Animal
  def speak
    puts "Meow!"
  end
Use code with caution. Learn more
Now, we can instantiate Dog and Cat classes:

Code snippet
dog = Dog.new
dog.speak # => "Woof!"

cat = Cat.new
cat.speak # => "Meow!"
Use code with caution. Learn more
We cannot instantiate Animal class because it is abstract:

Code snippet
animal = Animal.new # => NoMethodError: undefined method `new' for Animal:Class
Use code with caution. Learn more
Abstract classes are a useful way to provide a common interface for other classes to inherit from. 
They can be used to enforce certain behavior on subclasses, or to provide common functionality that can be reused by multiple classes.

As for why we cannot instantiate model classes, this is because model classes are designed to represent data in a database. 
They are not designed to be used as standalone objects. Instead, they are used in conjunction with controllers and views to create web applications.

Here is an example of how a model class can be used in a web application:

Code snippet
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  # ...
end

class ProductsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @products = Product.all
  end

  def show
    @product = Product.find(params[:id])
  end

  def new
    @product = Product.new
  end

  def create
    @product = Product.new(product_params)

    if @product.save
      redirect_to product_path(@product)
    else
      render :new
    end
  end

  private

  def product_params
    params.require(:product).permit(:name, :price, :description)
  end
end
Use code with caution. Learn more
In this example, the Product model class is used to represent data about products in a database. 
The ProductsController controller class uses the Product model class to get, create, update, and delete products from the database.

I hope this explanation of abstract classes and model classes in Rails is helpful.
