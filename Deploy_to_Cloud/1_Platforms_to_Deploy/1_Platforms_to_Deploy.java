You have several options for deploying a backend Ruby on Rails application with a managed database. The choice depends on your specific requirements, budget, and familiarity with the services. Here are some popular options:

1. **AWS Elastic Beanstalk with Amazon RDS**:
   - You can deploy your Rails application using AWS Elastic Beanstalk, as you've been trying, along with Amazon RDS for a managed database. Elastic Beanstalk simplifies the deployment and scaling of your application, and Amazon RDS takes care of database management.

2. **Heroku**:
   - Heroku is a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) that makes it easy to deploy and manage Rails applications. It provides a fully managed platform with integrated Heroku Postgres for your database needs.

3. **Google App Engine with Cloud SQL**:
   - If you prefer Google Cloud, you can use Google App Engine to deploy your Rails app and Cloud SQL for the managed database. App Engine abstracts the infrastructure, making deployment easier.

4. **Microsoft Azure with Azure Database for PostgreSQL**:
   - For those using Azure, you can deploy your Rails app on Azure App Service and use Azure Database for PostgreSQL for your managed database needs.

5. **DigitalOcean App Platform**:
   - DigitalOcean's App Platform is a fully managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling web apps. You can deploy Rails applications with managed databases on this platform.

6. **Vercel (for APIs)**:
   - If you're building a Rails API and prefer serverless architecture, consider Vercel. While it's more known for front-end deployments, it can handle serverless API deployments well.

7. **AWS Lambda + Amazon Aurora Serverless**:
   - For a serverless architecture, you can use AWS Lambda to run your Ruby code, and Amazon Aurora Serverless as your database. This approach offers auto-scaling benefits.

8. **Containerization (Docker) with Managed Database**:
   - You can containerize your Rails app using Docker and deploy it on a container management platform like AWS ECS, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Pair it with a managed database like Amazon RDS, Cloud SQL, or Azure Database for PostgreSQL.

Your choice will depend on factors such as your familiarity with the cloud provider, budget, performance requirements, and scaling needs. If you're looking for a fully managed and easy-to-use platform, Heroku is often a popular choice. If you have specific requirements or constraints, other cloud providers might be more suitable.

There are multiple platforms where you can deploy your Rails API app with a managed database. Here are a few options:

1. **Heroku**: Heroku is a cloud platform as a service (PaaS) that supports several programming languages, including Ruby. It provides a managed database service with [Heroku Postgres](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql) [Source 7](https://www.heroku.com/ruby).

2. **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: GCP offers [App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine) and [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) for deploying applications. For managed databases, you can use [Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql) [Source 0](https://cloud.google.com/ruby/rails/), [Source 1](https://cloud.google.com/ruby/rails/appengine), [Source 2](https://cloud.google.com/ruby/rails/run).

3. **Render**: Render is a unified platform to build and run all your apps and websites. It allows you to deploy your Rails app and provides managed PostgreSQL databases [Source 3](https://medium.com/@michaelmunavu83/deploying-rails-only-api-with-render-97b39ef4aaf8), [Source 4](https://dev.to/render/deploying-your-rails-6-app-4an4).

4. **AWS (Amazon Web Services)**: AWS offers a variety of services for deploying applications and managed databases. You can use AWS Elastic Beanstalk for deploying your Rails app and Amazon RDS for a managed database [Source 8](https://railsware.com/blog/ruby-on-rails-hosting-providers-for-your-application/).

5. **DigitalOcean**, **Linode**, **Vultr**, **UpCloud**, **A2 Hosting**, and **Hostwinds** all offer virtual private servers where you can deploy your Rails app. They also provide managed databases [Source 5](https://stackdiary.com/best-ruby-on-rails-hosting/).

Before choosing a platform, consider factors like cost, scalability, geographic location of servers, and the level of customer support. Each platform has its own set of instructions for deploying a Rails app, so make sure to follow the appropriate documentation.
