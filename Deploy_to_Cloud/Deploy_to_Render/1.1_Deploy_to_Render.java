Here is a summary of how to deploy a Rails API-only app to Render:

1. Make sure that your Rails app is set up to use PostgreSQL.
2. Create a build script to bundle your app and migrate your database.
3. Create a PostgreSQL database on Render.
4. Create a web service on Render and configure it to use your build script and start command.
5. Set the environment variables that your app requires, including `DATABASE_URL` and `RAILS_MASTER_KEY`.
6. Deploy your web service.

Here is a more detailed guide:

**1. Make sure that your Rails app is set up to use PostgreSQL.**

If you are creating a new Rails app, you can do this by running the following command:

```
rails new my-app --database=postgresql
```

If you are deploying an existing app, you need to make sure that your Gemfile includes the `pg` gem. You can do this by adding the following line to your Gemfile:

```
gem 'pg'
```

Once you have added the `pg` gem, run the following command to install your dependencies:

```
bundle install
```

**2. Create a build script to bundle your app and migrate your database.**

Create a new file in the `bin` directory called `render-build.sh` and add the following code to it:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# exit on error
set -o errexit

bundle install
bundle exec rake db:migrate
```

If you want to load seed values for your database, you can add the following line to the end of the file:

```
bundle exec rake db:seed
```

Make sure that the script is executable by running the following command:

```
chmod a+x bin/render-build.sh
```

**3. Create a PostgreSQL database on Render.**

1. Log in to Render and click the **New** button.
2. Select **PostgreSQL** and click **Continue**.
3. Give your database a name and select a region.
4. Click **Create Database**.

Once your database is created, copy the **Internal Database URL** to a safe place. You will need this when you configure your web service.

**4. Create a web service on Render and configure it to use your build script and start command.**

1. Click the **New** button and select **Web Service**.
2. Select your GitHub repository and click **Connect**.
3. Give your web service a name and select a region.
4. Under **Environment**, select **Ruby**.
5. Under **Build Command**, enter `./bin/render-build.sh`.
6. Under **Start Command**, enter `bundle exec puma -C config/puma.rb`.
7. Under **Plan**, select **Free**.
8. Click **Advanced**.
9. Under **Environment Variables**, add the following variables:
    * `DATABASE_URL`: The internal database URL that you copied in the previous step.
    * `RAILS_MASTER_KEY`: The contents of your `config/master.key` file.
10. Click **Create Web Service**.

**5. Deploy your web service.**

Click the **Deploy** button to deploy your web service. Once the deployment is complete, you can access your app at the URL that is provided to you.

**Conclusion**

This is a basic guide on how to deploy a Rails API-only app to Render. For more information, please see the Render documentation.
