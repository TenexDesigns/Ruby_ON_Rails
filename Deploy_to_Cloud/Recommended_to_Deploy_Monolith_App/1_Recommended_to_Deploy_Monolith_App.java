Yes, you can scale instances of a monolith app and put a load balancer to distribute traffic. This is a common way to improve the performance and scalability of monolith apps.

There are a few different ways to scale a monolith app. One way is to manually add more servers to your app. However, this can be time-consuming and error-prone.

A better way to scale a monolith app is to use a cloud-based autoscaler. An autoscaler is a tool that can automatically add and remove servers based on your app's load. This can help to ensure that your app is always available and responsive.

Once you have scaled your app, you can then put a load balancer in front of it to distribute traffic across your servers. A load balancer is a device that routes traffic to the best-available server. This can help to improve the performance of your app and make it more resilient to failures.

There are a few different types of load balancers, including hardware load balancers, software load balancers, and cloud-based load balancers. The best type of load balancer for your app will depend on your specific needs.

Here are some platforms that you can use to scale a monolith app and put a load balancer in front of it:

* **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**

These platforms all offer a variety of tools and services that can help you to scale your app and put a load balancer in front of it.

Here are some steps on how to scale a monolith app and put a load balancer in front of it:

1. **Choose a cloud platform.**
2. **Deploy your app to the cloud platform.**
3. **Create an autoscaler.**
4. **Create a load balancer.**
5. **Configure the load balancer to route traffic to your app.**

Once you have completed these steps, your app will be scalable and resilient to failures.

Here are some additional benefits of scaling a monolith app and putting a load balancer in front of it:

* **Improved performance:** Your app will be able to handle more traffic without slowing down.
* **Increased availability:** Your app will be less likely to go down.
* **Reduced costs:** You will only pay for the resources that you use.

I hope this helps!
