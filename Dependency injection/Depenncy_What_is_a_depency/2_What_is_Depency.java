A dependency in Rails is any object that a class needs in order to function. This could be another class, a module, or even a service. A dependency is considered a dependency if the class cannot function without it.

There are a few different types of dependencies in Rails:

* **Built-in dependencies:** These are dependencies that are provided by Rails itself, such as the `ActiveRecord` class and the `ApplicationController` class.
* **Third-party dependencies:** These are dependencies that are provided by third-party libraries, such as the `Devise` gem and the `Stripe` gem.
* **Custom dependencies:** These are dependencies that are created by you or your team, such as a `UserService` class or a `ProductRepository` class.

Any of these types of dependencies can require dependency injection, but it is most common to use dependency injection for custom dependencies. This is because custom dependencies are more likely to be shared by multiple classes and controllers.

Here are a few examples of dependencies in Rails:

* A `UserService` class that depends on a `UserRepository` class to save and retrieve users from the database.
* A `ProductsController` that depends on a `ProductService` class to get and update product information.
* A `StripePaymentService` class that depends on the `Stripe` gem to process credit card payments.

In all of these cases, the dependent class (the `UserService`, `ProductsController`, and `StripePaymentService` classes) cannot function without the dependency (the `UserRepository`, `ProductService`, and `Stripe` gem, respectively).

There are a few different ways to implement dependency injection in Rails. The most common way is to use the `inject` method. The `inject` method allows you to pass a dependency to a class as an argument.

For example, the following code shows how to use the `inject` method to pass a `UserRepository` dependency to a `UserService` class:

```ruby
class UserService
  def initialize(user_repository)
    @user_repository = user_repository
  end

  def create_user(params)
    user = User.new(params)
    @user_repository.save(user)
  end
end

class UserRepository
  def save(user)
    # Save the user to the database
  end
end
```

To create a new user, you would simply call the `create_user` method on the `UserService` class, passing in the user's parameters as an argument. The `UserService` class will then use the `UserRepository` dependency to save the user to the database.

Another way to implement dependency injection in Rails is to use a dependency injection library such as Dry::Inject. Dry::Inject provides a more powerful way to manage dependencies and make your code more consistent.

If you are new to dependency injection, I recommend using the `inject` method to get started. Once you have a better understanding of dependency injection, you can then consider using a dependency injection library.

Here are some additional tips for implementing dependency injection in Rails:

* Inject dependencies into your controllers and services, not your models. This will help to keep your models clean and focused on persisting data.
* Avoid circular dependencies. Circular dependencies can make your code difficult to understand and test.
* Use a dependency injection library such as Dry::Inject if you have a complex dependency injection setup.

By following these tips, you can implement dependency injection effectively in your Rails applications.
