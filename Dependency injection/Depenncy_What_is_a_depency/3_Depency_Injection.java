In Ruby on Rails, a "dependency" typically refers to an external service, object, or piece of functionality that a class or component relies on to perform its tasks. Dependencies can include database connections, external APIs, authentication services, logging services, and more. When these dependencies are required for the proper functioning of a class, it's essential to manage them efficiently, and this is where dependency injection comes into play.

A dependency can be classified as such if it meets the following criteria:

1. **External Entity**: Dependencies are often external to the class or component that uses them. They can be services, objects, or functionality that reside outside the class that requires them.

2. **Necessary for Operation**: The class relies on the dependency to execute its tasks successfully. Without the dependency, the class may not function correctly or at all.

3. **Potential for Variation**: Dependencies may change over time or have multiple implementations or configurations. Managing them through dependency injection allows for flexibility and adaptability.

Here's the best way to implement dependency injection in a Rails application with code samples:

1. **Identify Dependencies**: Begin by identifying the dependencies your class or component requires. For example, consider a service that needs access to a database connection and a logging service.

2. **Create a Container**: Set up a container to manage your dependencies. While Rails doesn't provide a built-in IoC (Inversion of Control) container, you can use third-party gems like `dry-container` or `waterbot` to create and configure a container. Here's an example using `dry-container`:

   ```ruby
   # Gemfile
   gem 'dry-container'
   ```

   ```ruby
   # config/initializers/dependencies.rb
   require 'dry/container'

   container = Dry::Container.new
   container.register(:database, DatabaseConnection.new)
   container.register(:logger, Logger.new)

   Rails.application.config.container = container
   ```

3. **Use Constructor Injection**: In your class, utilize constructor injection to accept the required dependencies as parameters. Here's an example:

   ```ruby
   class InvoiceService
     def initialize(database, logger)
       @database = database
       @logger = logger
     end

     def generate_invoice(order_id)
       @logger.info("Generating invoice for order ##{order_id}")
       # Access the database via @database
       # Business logic to generate the invoice
     end
   end
   ```

4. **Resolve Dependencies**: When creating instances of your class, use the container to resolve and provide the required dependencies:

   ```ruby
   container = Rails.application.config.container
   invoice_service = InvoiceService.new(container.resolve(:database), container.resolve(:logger))
   invoice_service.generate_invoice(123)
   ```

5. **Testing**: For testing, you can easily provide mock or stub dependencies to isolate the class under test. This promotes clean, focused, and independent unit testing.

By following this approach, you can effectively manage and inject dependencies in your Rails application, making your code more modular, testable, and maintainable while maintaining flexibility and adaptability.
