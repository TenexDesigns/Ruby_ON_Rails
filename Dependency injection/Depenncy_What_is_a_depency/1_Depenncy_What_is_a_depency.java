In a Rails application, a dependency is any object that your class needs to operate. For instance, if you have a `InvoiceService` that uses a `UserNotifier` to send notifications, then `UserNotifier` is a dependency for `InvoiceService`. 

```ruby
class InvoiceService
  def initialize(user)
    @user = user
    @notifier = UserNotifier.new
  end

  def create_invoice(invoice_details)
    # Business logic to create an invoice
    @notifier.notify(@user)
  end
end
```

In this case, `InvoiceService` is tightly coupled with `UserNotifier`. This means that if you want to change the way notifications are sent (for example, using a different notifier), you would need to change the `InvoiceService` class itself. Additionally, testing `InvoiceService` would be difficult because it's directly creating an instance of `UserNotifier`, making it hard to isolate `InvoiceService` from `UserNotifier` in tests.

Dependency injection can help to address these issues. By passing the `UserNotifier` (or any other notifier) to `InvoiceService` as a parameter, we can make the notifier interchangeable, and we can isolate `InvoiceService` in tests by passing in a test double:

```ruby
class InvoiceService
  def initialize(user, notifier)
    @user = user
    @notifier = notifier
  end

  def create_invoice(invoice_details)
    # Business logic to create an invoice
    @notifier.notify(@user)
  end
end
```

In this version of the `InvoiceService` class, the notifier is injected as a dependency, making `InvoiceService` more flexible and easier to test [Source 4](https://dev.to/loribbaum/rails-6-dependency-management-with-service-objects-hjc), [Source 14](https://dev.to/vladhilko/how-to-implement-dependency-injection-pattern-in-ruby-on-rails-28d6), [Source 16](https://gorails.com/episodes/dependency-injection-ruby), [Source 17](https://www.codewithjason.com/dependency-injection-can-make-rails-tests-easier/).

When implementing dependency injection in Rails, here are some best practices to follow:

- **Default to simplicity**: You don't always need to inject every dependency. If a dependency is unlikely to change, or if it doesn't make testing difficult, it may be simpler and more readable to instantiate it directly.

- **Use initializer arguments**: The simplest way to inject dependencies in Rails is to pass them as arguments to the class's initializer method.

- **Provide default dependencies**: To keep your class easy to use, provide default dependencies that will be used if the caller doesn't provide their own.

- **Use factories or dependency injection frameworks**: For complex applications with many dependencies, consider using a factory method or a dependency injection framework to manage your dependencies.
