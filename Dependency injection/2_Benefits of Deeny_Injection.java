The implementation of using dependency injection to pass dependencies to the `InvoiceService` (or any other business logic class) has several advantages over passing the required items as parameters directly to the class's methods:

1. **Testability**: When you pass dependencies through dependency injection, it becomes much easier to write unit tests for your business logic. You can provide mock or stub versions of the dependencies, allowing you to isolate and test the class without needing the real database, external services, or complex objects. This makes your tests more focused and less reliant on the availability of external resources.

2. **Flexibility**: Using constructor injection with a dependency container allows you to change the implementation of a dependency without modifying the `InvoiceService` class. For example, if you decide to switch to a different logging library or data source, you can make the change in the dependency container configuration rather than updating every place where `InvoiceService` is used.

3. **Reusability**: The dependency container can be reused across different parts of your application. If multiple classes require the same dependencies, you can configure the container once and provide those dependencies as needed, promoting code reusability and reducing redundancy.

4. **Readability and Maintainability**: Constructor injection makes the code more readable and less cluttered. Passing numerous parameters to methods can make the code harder to understand, especially when the number of parameters increases. With constructor injection, the dependencies are clearly defined in one place, making the class constructor self-documenting.

5. **Separation of Concerns**: By delegating the responsibility of dependency management to a separate container, you achieve a better separation of concerns. The `InvoiceService` class can focus on its primary task (generating invoices) rather than worrying about how to obtain its dependencies. This follows the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and improves code maintainability.

6. **Reduced Coupling**: Directly passing dependencies as method parameters creates tighter coupling between classes. If you change the method signature by adding or removing parameters, you would need to update every place where that method is called. Dependency injection reduces this coupling, making your code more flexible and less prone to errors when changes are made.

In summary, using dependency injection and a container for managing dependencies enhances the overall quality of your code by improving testability, flexibility, and maintainability. It follows best practices for software design, such as the SOLID principles, and promotes clean and modular code. While there may be a slight learning curve to set up and configure a dependency container, the benefits it brings to your Rails application make it a valuable approach.
