In Rails, a many-to-many relationship between two models (like `User` and `Group`) can be represented using an intermediary model (like `Membership`). 

Here's how you can set it up:

1. Create your `User`, `Group`, and `Membership` models:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :memberships
  has_many :groups, through: :memberships
end

class Group < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :memberships
  has_many :users, through: :memberships
end

class Membership < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
  belongs_to :group
end
```

2. Next, you need to create the corresponding database tables. You can generate migrations to do this:

```bash
rails generate migration CreateUsers name:string
rails generate migration CreateGroups name:string
rails generate migration CreateMemberships user:references group:references
```

3. Run the migrations:

```bash
rails db:migrate
```

With this setup, a `User` can belong to many `Groups` and a `Group` can have many `Users`, with the `Membership` model serving as the join table. 

The SQL for querying all groups for a specific user would look like this:

```sql
SELECT "groups".* FROM "groups" 
INNER JOIN "memberships" ON "groups"."id" = "memberships"."group_id" 
WHERE "memberships"."user_id" = ?
```

And if you want to query all users for a specific group, you would use:

```sql
SELECT "users".* FROM "users" 
INNER JOIN "memberships" ON "users"."id" = "memberships"."user_id" 
WHERE "memberships"."group_id" = ?
```

In both cases, the "?" would be replaced with the id of the user or group you're querying for.
