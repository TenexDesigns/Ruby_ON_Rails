To represent a many-to-many relationship in Rails, we use a join table. This is a table that contains two foreign keys, one for each model in the relationship. The join table does not need to have any other attributes, but it is often helpful to add some to store additional information about the relationship.

In your example, we would create a join table called `memberships` with two foreign keys, `user_id` and `group_id`. This table would store the relationship between users and groups.

Here is a code example of how to set up a many-to-many relationship between users and groups using `has_many :through`:

```ruby
class User
  has_many :memberships
  has_many :groups, through: :memberships
end

class Group
  has_many :memberships
  has_many :users, through: :memberships
end
```

This code will create the following SQL tables:

```sql
# users table
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255)
);

# groups table
CREATE TABLE groups (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255)
);

# memberships table
CREATE TABLE memberships (
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  group_id INTEGER REFERENCES groups(id)
);
```

To add a user to a group, we can use the following code:

```ruby
user = User.find(1)
group = Group.find(2)

user.groups << group
```

This will create a new row in the `memberships` table, linking the user and the group.

To get a list of all the groups that a user belongs to, we can use the following code:

```ruby
user = User.find(1)

groups = user.groups
```

This will return an array of all the groups that the user is a member of.

To get a list of all the users who are members of a group, we can use the following code:

```ruby
group = Group.find(2)

users = group.users
```

This will return an array of all the users who are members of the group.

I hope this helps!
