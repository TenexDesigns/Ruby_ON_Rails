In Ruby on Rails, there are established naming conventions for associations, class names, and foreign keys that help Rails automatically infer the relationships between models and tables. These conventions are designed to make your code more readable and maintainable. Here are the common naming conventions for associations, class names, and foreign keys:

1. **Associations in Models:**

   - **has_many:** Use the plural form of the associated model's name.
     - Example: If a `Game` has many `Reviews`, you would define the association as `has_many :reviews`.

   - **belongs_to:** Use the singular form of the associated model's name. You can also specify the `class_name` and `foreign_key` options if the association name doesn't match the class name or the foreign key.
     - Example: If a `Review` belongs to an `Author`, you can define the association as `belongs_to :author`.

   - **has_one:** Similar to `belongs_to`, use the singular form of the associated model's name.

   - **has_and_belongs_to_many:** Use the plural form of the associated model's name.

2. **Class Names:**

   - By default, Rails uses the class name of the associated model, converted to singular or plural form as appropriate. However, you can specify the `class_name` option if the class name differs from the inferred name.
     - Example: If a `Review` belongs to an `Author`, you don't need to specify the class name because Rails can infer it. But if the author's class name is different, you can specify it like this: `belongs_to :author, class_name: 'CustomAuthor'`.

3. **Foreign Keys in Migrations:**

   - By default, Rails will automatically create foreign key columns in migrations using the pattern `<association_name>_id`. For example, if a `Review` belongs to an `Author`, Rails will create a `author_id` foreign key column in the `reviews` table.

   - You can also specify the `foreign_key` option in the migration if you want to use a different name for the foreign key.
     - Example: `t.references :author, foreign_key: { to_table: :custom_authors }` would create a foreign key column named `author_id` in the `reviews` table that references the `custom_authors` table.

4. **Custom Association Names:**

   - If you want to use a custom name for an association, you can specify it using the `:as` option. This is often used with polymorphic associations.

   - Example: If you have a polymorphic association between a `Comment` and different commentable models, you can define it like this: `belongs_to :commentable, polymorphic: true, optional: true, foreign_key: "commentable_id", foreign_type: "commentable_type"`.

To ensure that custom association names are correctly linked to the intended models or tables, you should specify the `class_name` and `foreign_key` options as needed. This allows you to have clear and explicit control over the relationships in your Rails application.

Overall, using these naming conventions and options in your associations and migrations helps Rails maintain the correct relationships between your models and tables.
