Yes, Ruby on Rails (often referred to as Rails) uses a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) that is built on top of the Ruby programming language. This DSL provides a set of conventions and abstractions that make it easier to develop web applications in Rails.

Here are some key DSL components used in Rails web development:

1. **Routes DSL**: Rails provides a DSL for defining routes in the `config/routes.rb` file. This DSL allows you to map URLs to controller actions, specify HTTP methods, and define route parameters. For example:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get '/articles', to: 'articles#index'
  post '/articles', to: 'articles#create'
  get '/articles/:id', to: 'articles#show'
  # ...
end
```

2. **Controller DSL**: Rails controllers use a DSL to define actions and handle requests. The controller actions are defined as methods, and the DSL provides methods for rendering views, redirecting, setting response headers, and handling parameters. For example:

```ruby
class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @articles = Article.all
  end

  def show
    @article = Article.find(params[:id])
  end

  def create
    @article = Article.new(article_params)
    if @article.save
      redirect_to @article
    else
      render 'new'
    end
  end

  # ...
end
```

3. **Model DSL**: Rails models use a DSL to define the structure and behavior of the application's data. The DSL provides methods for defining associations, validations, callbacks, and other database-related operations. For example:

```ruby
class Article < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
  has_many :comments

  validates :title, presence: true
  # ...
end
```

4. **View DSL**: Rails views use a DSL to generate HTML or other output that is sent back to the client. The DSL provides methods for rendering templates, accessing instance variables from the controller, and generating forms. For example:

```erb
<!-- app/views/articles/index.html.erb -->
<h1>Articles</h1>
<ul>
  <% @articles.each do |article| %>
    <li><%= link_to article.title, article_path(article) %></li>
  <% end %>
</ul>
```

These are just a few examples of the DSL components used in Rails web development. The Rails DSL aims to provide a clean and expressive syntax that allows developers to write concise and readable code. It abstracts away many of the lower-level details of web development, making it easier to build web applications quickly.
