Sure! Here are some explanations and code samples for the DSL features used in GraphQL Rails API web development:

1. **Active Record DSL**: The Active Record DSL allows you to interact with the database to fetch and manipulate data. This is essential for GraphQL APIs, which need to access data from the database to respond to queries. Here's an example of using Active Record to fetch data:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :posts
end

class Post < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
end
```

2. **GraphQL Schema DSL**: The GraphQL Schema DSL allows you to define the types and fields exposed by your GraphQL API. This is necessary for GraphQL clients to know what data they can query and what operations they can perform. Here's an example of defining a GraphQL schema using the graphql-ruby gem:

```ruby
class Types::UserType < Types::BaseObject
  field :id, ID, null: false
  field :name, String, null: false
  field :email, String, null: false
  field :posts, [Types::PostType], null: true
end

class Types::PostType < Types::BaseObject
  field :id, ID, null: false
  field :title, String, null: false
  field :body, String, null: false
  field :user, Types::UserType, null: false
end

class Types::QueryType < Types::BaseObject
  field :user, Types::UserType, null: true do
    argument :id, ID, required: true
  end

  def user(id:)
    User.find(id)
  end
end
```

3. **GraphQL Resolvers**: GraphQL resolvers are responsible for fetching and manipulating the data returned in response to queries. Resolvers can be written using Ruby code, and they can use the Active Record DSL to interact with the database. Here's an example of a resolver using Active Record:

```ruby
class Types::UserType < Types::BaseObject
  field :posts, [Types::PostType], null: true

  def posts
    object.posts
  end
end
```

4. **GraphQL Mutations**: GraphQL mutations are used to modify data on the server. Mutations can also be written using Ruby code, and they can use the Active Record DSL to interact with the database. Here's an example of a mutation using Active Record:

```ruby
class Types::MutationType < Types::BaseObject
  field :create_post, Types::PostType, null: false do
    argument :title, String, required: true
    argument :body, String, required: true
  end

  def create_post(title:, body:)
    Post.create(title: title, body: body)
  end
end
```

5. **GraphQL Associations**: GraphQL associations allow you to define relationships between different GraphQL types. Associations can be defined using the GraphQL Schema DSL, and they can be used in queries and mutations. Here's an example of defining an association between User and Post types:

```ruby
class Types::UserType < Types::BaseObject
  field :posts, [Types::PostType], null: true
end

class Types::PostType < Types::BaseObject
  field :user, Types::UserType, null: false
end
```

These are some of the DSL features used in GraphQL Rails API web development. Additionally, Rails provides other features like ActionController for routing and request handling, ActionMailer for sending emails, and ActiveJob for performing asynchronous tasks.
