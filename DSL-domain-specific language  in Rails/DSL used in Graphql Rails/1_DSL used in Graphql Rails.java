When building a GraphQL API with Ruby on Rails, you'll primarily use the DSL (Domain-Specific Language) features provided by the GraphQL-Ruby gem. GraphQL is a query language for APIs, and GraphQL-Ruby helps you implement and serve GraphQL APIs in your Rails application. Here are some DSL features commonly used when developing GraphQL APIs with Ruby on Rails:

**1. Schema DSL:**
   - GraphQL-Ruby provides a DSL for defining your API schema. You'll use this DSL to specify the types (e.g., Query, Mutation, Object, Input, Scalar types), fields, and their relationships. Here's an example of defining a GraphQL schema:

     ```ruby
     class Types::QueryType < Types::BaseObject
       field :user, Types::UserType, null: true, description: "Find a user by ID" do
         argument :id, ID, required: true
       end

       def user(id:)
         User.find(id)
       end
     end
     ```

**2. Resolvers:**
   - Resolvers are responsible for executing queries and mutations. In GraphQL-Ruby, you define resolvers to retrieve data for fields. You can use DSL features to specify arguments, types, and how the resolver fetches data from your models or other sources.

     ```ruby
     field :user, Types::UserType, null: true, description: "Find a user by ID" do
       argument :id, ID, required: true
     end
     ```

**3. Input Objects:**
   - GraphQL-Ruby provides a DSL for defining input object types used to pass complex input parameters to mutations. You can specify fields and their types within an input object type.

     ```ruby
     input_object do
       argument :name, String, required: true
       argument :email, String, required: true
       argument :password, String, required: true
     end
     ```

**4. Mutations:**
   - When defining mutations (operations that modify data), you can use DSL features to specify the input, output types, arguments, and how the mutation resolves.

     ```ruby
     field :createUser, Types::UserType, null: true do
       argument :input, Types::UserInputType, required: true
     end
     ```

**5. Custom Scalar Types:**
   - You can create custom scalar types and define their behavior using GraphQL-Ruby's DSL. For instance, you can define a Date scalar type and specify how it's serialized and parsed.

**6. Authentication and Authorization:**
   - While not strictly a DSL, you'll often use Rails' authentication and authorization features to secure your GraphQL API endpoints. You may define permissions and access control logic using DSLs or configuration files.

These are some of the key DSL features used when building GraphQL APIs in Ruby on Rails. The GraphQL-Ruby gem provides a well-structured DSL for defining your API schema, types, queries, mutations, and their behavior. This allows you to implement a robust and flexible GraphQL API that follows best practices and conventions.
