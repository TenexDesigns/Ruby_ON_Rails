Yes, Ruby on Rails (often referred to as Rails) is a web development framework that utilizes a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for building web applications. Rails is designed to be both developer-friendly and productive, and it employs several DSLs and conventions to make web development in Ruby easier and more elegant. Here are some of the primary DSLs used in Rails:

**1. Routing DSL:**
   - Rails provides a DSL for defining URL routes. You can specify routes and associate them with controller actions using a clean and expressive DSL. For example:

     ```ruby
     Rails.application.routes.draw do
       get 'posts' => 'posts#index'
       post 'posts' => 'posts#create'
       get 'posts/:id' => 'posts#show'
     end
     ```

**2. ActiveRecord DSL:**
   - ActiveRecord is Rails ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library, and it provides a DSL for working with your application's database. You can define database schemas, relationships, and queries using a Ruby-based DSL. For example:

     ```ruby
     class User < ApplicationRecord
       has_many :posts
     end
     ```

**3. Migration DSL:**
   - Rails uses a DSL for defining and executing database schema migrations. You can create and modify database tables, columns, and indexes using Ruby code. For example:

     ```ruby
     class CreatePosts < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.1]
       def change
         create_table :posts do |t|
           t.string :title
           t.text :content
           t.references :user, foreign_key: true
           t.timestamps
         end
       end
     end
     ```

**4. View Templates:**
   - Rails leverages the ERB (Embedded Ruby) templating engine to embed Ruby code directly into HTML templates. This allows you to use Ruby for dynamic content in your views. For example:

     ```erb
     <h1><%= @post.title %></h1>
     <p><%= @post.content %></p>
     ```

**5. Configuration DSL:**
   - Rails provides a DSL for application configuration. You can set various options and configurations using Ruby code in the `config` directory.

   - There are many more DSLs and conventions in Rails that help developers build web applications more efficiently, including form builders, controller actions, model validations, and more.

Rails use of DSLs and conventions makes it highly productive and allows developers to write clean, expressive, and maintainable code. It's one of the reasons why Rails is known for its developer-friendly approach to web development.
