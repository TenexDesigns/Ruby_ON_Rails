Yes, Rails uses a number of DSLs of Ruby for web development. These DSLs make it easier to write code that is specific to the web development domain.

Here are a few examples of DSLs that are used in Rails:

* **Routing DSL:** The routing DSL allows you to define how HTTP requests are mapped to controller actions.
* **Active Record DSL:** The Active Record DSL allows you to interact with the database.
* **View DSL:** The view DSL allows you to generate HTML templates for your web pages.

These are just a few examples, and there are many other DSLs that are used in Rails.

Here is an example of the routing DSL:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  root to: "pages#home"
  resources :posts
end
```

This routing DSL defines two routes:

* A root route that maps the "/" request to the `home` action of the `PagesController` class.
* A resources route that maps requests for posts to the `PostsController` class.

Here is an example of the Active Record DSL:

```ruby
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :comments
end
```

This Active Record DSL defines a `Post` model that has a many-to-one relationship with the `Comment` model.

Here is an example of the view DSL:

```ruby
<h1><%= @post.title %></h1>
<p><%= @post.body %></p>
```

This view DSL generates an HTML template that displays the title and body of the `@post` variable.

These DSLs make it easier to write code that is specific to the web development domain. They also make the code more readable and maintainable.

In addition to the DSLs that are provided by Rails, you can also create your own DSLs to meet the specific needs of your application. This is one of the things that makes Ruby such a powerful language for web development.
