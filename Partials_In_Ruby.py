Partials in Rails are reusable view templates that can be shared across multiple views.
They allow you to extract common or repetitive HTML code into a separate file, 
making your views more modular and easier to maintain.
Heres how you can use partials in Rails:

Create a Partial File:
Start by creating a partial file with a name that begins with an underscore (_).
For example, _header.html.erb or _sidebar.html.erb. Place this file in the app/views directory or in a subdirectory
corresponding to the controller or view context where it will be used.

Add HTML Code:
In the partial file, write the HTML code that you want to reuse. This can include any combination of HTML, ERB tags, and Ruby code.

Example _header.html.erb:


<header>
  <h1>Welcome to My App</h1>
  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li>Home</li>
      <li>About</li>
      <li>Contact</li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</header>
Include the Partial in a View:
To use the partial in a view, simply call the render method and specify the name of the partial file as a symbol or string.

Example home.html.erb:


<html>
  <body>
    <%= render 'header' %>

    <main>
      <h2>Home Page</h2>
      <p>Welcome to my website.</p>
    </main>

    <%= render 'footer' %>
  </body>
</html>
Passing Local Variables:
Partials can also accept local variables, allowing you to pass dynamic data to them.
To pass local variables, you can use the locals option with the render method.

Example home.html.erb with local variable:


<html>
  <body>
    <%= render 'header', welcome_message: 'Hello, Guest!' %>

    <main>
      <h2>Home Page</h2>
      <p>Welcome to my website.</p>
    </main>

    <%= render 'footer' %>
  </body>
</html>

Example _header.html.erb accessing the local variable:


<header>
  <h1><%= welcome_message %></h1>
  <!-- Rest of the code -->
</header>
Reusing Partials:
You can reuse partials across multiple views by simply including them using the render method in the desired views.

Example about.html.erb:


<html>
  <body>
    <%= render 'header', welcome_message: 'About Us' %>

    <main>
      <h2>About Page</h2>
      <p>Learn more about our company.</p>
    </main>

    <%= render 'footer' %>
  </body>
</html>
By using partials, you can keep your view code DRY (Dont Repeat Yourself), 
promote code reusability, and make your views more organized and maintainable in Rails.

Partials are a way to reuse code in Rails views. They are typically used to render common elements, such as headers,
footers, and sidebars.

To create a partial, create a file with the extension .html.erb in the app/views directory.
The name of the file should be prefixed with an underscore (_). For example, to create a partial for a header,
you would create a file called _header.html.erb.

The contents of the partial file should be the HTML for the element you want to reuse.
For example, the following partial file would render a header with the title "My App":

Code snippet
<header>
  <h1>My App</h1>
</header>

To render a partial in a view, use the render helper.
The render helper takes two arguments: the name of the partial and any local variables that you want to pass to the partial. 
For example, the following code would render the _header partial and pass the title variable to the partial:

Code snippet
<%= render '_header', title: 'My App' %>
Use code with caution. Learn more
The partial will be rendered inside the current view, with the local variables that you passed to it.

Here are some additional tips for using partials:

You can use partials to render complex elements, such as forms and tables.
You can use partials to keep your views DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
You can use partials to improve the performance of your application by reducing the amount of HTML that needs to be rendered.
Partials are a powerful tool that can help you to write more maintainable and efficient Rails applications.

To use partials in Rails, you can follow these steps:

Create a new partial file: To create a partial, you need to create a new file that begins with an underscore,
for example, _form.html.erb [5]. Place the partial file in the app/views/shared folder [2].
Define the partial content: Write the HTML and Ruby code you want to reuse in the partial file. 
For example, you can create a simple partial for a navigation bar like this:
<!-- app/views/shared/_navigation_bar.html.erb -->
<nav>
  <ul>
    <li><%= link_to "Home", root_path %></li>
    <li><%= link_to "About", about_path %></li>
    <li><%= link_to "Contact", contact_path %></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
Render the partial in a view: To render the partial in a view, use the render method followed by the partials name.
If the partial is located in the same view folder, you can simply call its name [3].
For example, if you want to render the navigation bar partial in your app/views/layouts/application.html.erb file,
you can do the following:
                                             
<!-- app/views/layouts/application.html.erb -->
<%= render "shared/navigation_bar" %>
Pass data to the partial: If you need to pass data to the partial, you can use local variables.
For example, if you want to pass a list of links to the navigation bar partial, you can do the following:
<!-- app/views/layouts/application.html.erb -->
<%= render "shared/navigation_bar", links: [root_path, about_path, contact_path] %>
Then, in your partial file, you can access the data using the local variable:

<!-- app/views/shared/_navigation_bar.html.erb -->
<nav>
  <ul>
    <% links.each do |link, path| %>
      <li><%= link_to link, path %></li>
    <% end %>
  </ul>
</nav>
By following these steps, you can create and use partials in Rails to keep your code
DRY (Dont Repeat Yourself) and maintain a more organized and modular codebase [9].
