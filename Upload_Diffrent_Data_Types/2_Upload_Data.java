The article you're referring to is the official Ruby on Rails guide for Active Storage. Active Storage is a built-in library in Rails that facilitates uploading files to cloud storage services like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Microsoft Azure Storage, and attaching those files to Active Record objects.

Here are the main areas covered in the guide:

1. **What is Active Storage?**: It explains what Active Storage is and its requirements.

2. **Setup**: It provides instructions on how to set up Active Storage in a Rails application.

3. **Different Storage Services**: It explains how to configure different storage services like Disk, Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure Storage, Google Cloud Storage, and Mirror Service.

4. **Attaching Files to Records**: It explains how to attach one or many files to a record using `has_one_attached` and `has_many_attached` methods.

5. **Attaching File/IO Objects**: It explains how to attach a file that doesn’t arrive via an HTTP request.

6. **Replacing vs Adding Attachments**: It explains the difference between replacing and adding attachments.

7. **Form Validation**: It explains how to validate attachments in forms.

Here are some code samples from the guide:

- **Setting up Active Storage**:

```ruby
$ bin/rails active_storage:install
$ bin/rails db:migrate
```

- **Attaching a file to a record**:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_one_attached :avatar
end
```

- **Attaching multiple files to a record**:

```ruby
class Message < ApplicationRecord
  has_many_attached :images
end
```

- **Attaching a file from a form**:

```ruby
def create
  message = Message.create!(message_params)
  redirect_to message
end

private
  def message_params
    params.require(:message).permit(:title, :content, images: [])
  end
```

- **Attaching a file that doesn’t arrive via an HTTP request**:

```ruby
@message.images.attach(io: File.open('/path/to/file'), filename: 'file.pdf', content_type: 'application/pdf')
```

These code samples are used in the context of a Rails application. For example, the `has_one_attached` and `has_many_attached` methods are used in Rails models to define a relationship between the model and the attached files. The `attach` method is used in Rails controllers to attach files to a record.
