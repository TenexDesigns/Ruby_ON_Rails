Uploading Images and Videos

To upload images and videos in Rails, we can use the Active Storage gem. Active Storage provides a unified interface for storing files in a variety of different locations, including the local filesystem, Amazon S3, and Google Cloud Storage.

To use Active Storage, we first need to install the gem:

gem install active_storage
Once the gem is installed, we need to generate a migration to create the necessary database tables:

rails generate active_storage:install
This will create two new tables: active_storage_blobs and active_storage_attachments. The active_storage_blobs table stores the actual file data, while the active_storage_attachments table stores the relationship between the files and the models that own them.

Next, we need to add the ActiveStorage::Attached::HasMany association to our Post model:

Ruby
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  has_many_attached :files
end
Use code with caution. Learn more
This will allow us to attach multiple files to each post.

To upload a file, we can use the attach() method:

Ruby
post = Post.new
post.files.attach(params[:file])
Use code with caution. Learn more
This will upload the file to Active Storage and create a new record in the active_storage_blobs table.

Saving Images and Videos

Once the file has been uploaded, we need to save it to the database. To do this, we can use the save() method:

Ruby
post.save
Use code with caution. Learn more
This will save the post and all of its attached files to the database.

Getting Images and Videos

To get the images and videos attached to a post, we can use the files() method:

Ruby
post = Post.find(1)

files = post.files
Use code with caution. Learn more
This will return an array of all the files attached to the post.

To get the URL of a file, we can use the url() method:

Ruby
file = files.first

file_url = file.url
Use code with caution. Learn more
This will return the URL of the file, which we can then use to display it in our application.

Removing Uploaded Images

To remove an uploaded image or video, we can use the purge() method:

Ruby
file = files.first

file.purge
Use code with caution. Learn more
This will remove the file from Active Storage and delete the corresponding record from the active_storage_blobs table.

Storing Uploaded Images and Videos

Active Storage can store uploaded images and videos in a variety of different locations, including the local filesystem, Amazon S3, and Google Cloud Storage.

To configure where Active Storage should store your files, you can set the AWS_REGION and AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID environment variables. If you are using Amazon S3, you will also need to create an S3 bucket and configure Active Storage to use it.

If you are using the local filesystem, you can set the ACTIVE_STORAGE_LOCAL_PATH environment variable to the path where you want to store your files.

Displaying Uploaded Images and Videos

To display uploaded images and videos in your application, you can use the image_tag() helper method:

Ruby
<%= image_tag file_url %>
Use code with caution. Learn more
This will generate an <img> tag with the source set to the URL of the file.

If you are uploading videos, you can use the video_tag() helper method to display them:

Ruby
<%= video_tag file_url %>
Use code with caution. Learn more
This will generate a <video> tag with the source set to the URL of the file.

Other Considerations

One thing to keep in mind when uploading images and videos is that they can be very large files. To avoid using up too much storage space, you may want to resize your images and videos before uploading them.

You may also want to consider using a CDN to serve your images and videos. This can help to improve the performance of your application by reducing the load on your server.

Conclusion

Active Storage is a powerful tool for uploading and managing images and videos in Rails. It provides a unified interface for storing files in a variety of different locations, and it makes it easy to display them in your application.

Code Samples

Here are some code samples for uploading, saving, getting, removing, displaying, and storing images and videos in Rails using Active Storage:

Ruby
# Upload an image
post = Post.new
post.files.attach(params[:file])

# Save the post and all of its attached files
post.save

# Get the images and videos attached to a post
post = Post.find(1)
files = post.files
Use code with caution. Learn more
