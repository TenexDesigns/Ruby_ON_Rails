Here are explanations and code samples for the key areas covered in the Active Storage guide in Ruby on Rails:

1. **Setup**:
   - Instructions for setting up Active Storage in a Rails application.
   - Running specific Rails commands to install Active Storage and migrate the database.

   Code Sample:
   ```shell
   $ bin/rails active_storage:install
   $ bin/rails db:migrate
   ```

2. **Different Storage Services**:
   - Explains how to configure various storage services like Disk, Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure Storage, Google Cloud Storage, and Mirror Service.
   - Each service has its own configuration requirements, and the guide provides detailed instructions for each.

   Code Sample (Configuring Amazon S3):
   ```yaml
   amazon:
     service: S3
     access_key_id: ""
     secret_access_key: ""
     region: ""
     bucket: ""
   ```

3. **Attaching Files to Records**:
   - Explains how to attach one or many files to a record using `has_one_attached` and `has_many_attached` methods.
   - `has_one_attached` is used for one-to-one relationships, while `has_many_attached` is used for one-to-many relationships between records and files.

   Code Sample (Attaching an Image to a User):
   ```ruby
   class User < ApplicationRecord
     has_one_attached :avatar
   end
   ```

   Code Sample (Attaching Multiple Images to a Blog Post):
   ```ruby
   class BlogPost < ApplicationRecord
     has_many_attached :images
   end
   ```

4. **Form Validation**:
   - Explains how to validate attachments in forms.
   - Important for ensuring that uploaded files meet specific criteria (e.g., file type or size).

   Code Sample (Form Validation in a Controller):
   ```ruby
   def create
     message = Message.create!(message_params)
     redirect_to message
   end
   ```

5. **Transforming Images**:
   - Explains how to use variants to transform images.
   - Variants allow you to create different versions of an uploaded image, such as thumbnails or grayscale versions.

   Code Sample (Creating a Thumbnail Variant):
   ```ruby
   class User < ApplicationRecord
     has_one_attached :avatar do |attachable|
       attachable.variant :thumb, resize_to_limit: [100, 100]
     end
   end
   ```

6. **Previewing Files**:
   - Explains how to generate an image representation of a non-image file, such as a PDF or a video.
   - Useful for providing previews of files to users.

   Code Sample (Previewing a Thumbnail of a Video):
   ```ruby
   <%= image_tag user.video.preview(:thumb) %>
   ```

7. **Direct Uploads**:
   - Explains how to send file uploads directly from browsers to a storage service, bypassing your application servers.
   - Improves performance by offloading the work of handling file uploads to the storage service.

8. **Testing**:
   - Explains how to clean up files stored during testing to keep the test environment clean and prevent interference between tests.

These topics are used throughout a Rails application, including models for defining attachments, controllers for handling file uploads and downloads, and views for creating forms for file uploads.
