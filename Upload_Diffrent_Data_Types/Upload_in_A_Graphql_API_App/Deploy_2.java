For the above GraphQL app, I recommend using Amazon S3 to store your uploaded images and videos. S3 is a highly scalable and reliable cloud storage service that is well-suited for storing large amounts of data. It is also relatively inexpensive, especially if you use the right storage class and lifecycle policies.

Here are some of the benefits of using S3 to store your uploaded images and videos:

* **Scalability:** S3 is highly scalable, so you can easily add more storage capacity as needed.
* **Reliability:** S3 is a highly reliable service, with a 99.999999999% durability guarantee.
* **Performance:** S3 offers high performance for both reads and writes.
* **Security:** S3 offers a variety of security features to protect your data.
* **Cost:** S3 is relatively inexpensive, especially if you use the right storage class and lifecycle policies.

**Cost of S3**

The cost of S3 storage varies depending on the storage class and region that you choose. For example, Standard storage in the US East (N. Virginia) region costs $0.023 per GB per month. However, you can reduce your costs by using a lower-cost storage class, such as Infrequent Access or Glacier, or by using lifecycle policies to automatically move data to lower-cost storage classes when it is no longer frequently accessed.

**Deploying your backend**

There are a variety of ways to deploy your Rails API backend. One popular option is to use a cloud hosting provider such as AWS Elastic Beanstalk or Heroku. These providers offer a variety of features to make it easy to deploy and manage your application.

Another option is to deploy your backend to a dedicated server. This can give you more control over your environment, but it also requires more expertise and maintenance.

**Where to get the best deal**

The best deal for deploying your backend will depend on your specific needs and requirements. If you are looking for a simple and affordable solution, I recommend using a cloud hosting provider. If you need more control over your environment or have specific performance requirements, you may want to consider deploying to a dedicated server.

**Database**

For the database, I recommend using PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL is a free and open-source object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) that is well-suited for both small and large applications. It is also highly scalable and reliable.

**Cost of PostgreSQL**

PostgreSQL is a free and open-source software, so there is no cost to use it. However, you may need to pay for hosting costs if you are deploying your database to a cloud hosting provider.

**Conclusion**

I recommend using Amazon S3 to store your uploaded images and videos, PostgreSQL for the database, and a cloud hosting provider to deploy your backend. This is a cost-effective and reliable solution that can scale to meet the needs of your application.
