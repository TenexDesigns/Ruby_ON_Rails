For an application that involves uploading, storing, and serving images and videos through a GraphQL backend, the choice of infrastructure and services can significantly impact your costs and performance. Here are some recommendations:

1. **Cloud Storage for Media Files**:
   - Use a cloud storage service like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage for storing images and videos. These services are cost-effective and highly scalable. The choice of the cloud provider may depend on your specific requirements and existing infrastructure.

2. **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**:
   - Consider using a CDN like Amazon CloudFront, Google Cloud CDN, or Akamai to deliver media files to end-users with low latency. CDNs distribute your content globally, improving performance and reducing data transfer costs.

3. **Database Costs**:
   - Database costs can vary depending on your chosen database service. Popular choices for Rails applications include Amazon RDS, Google Cloud SQL, or managed PostgreSQL services. Costs depend on the service tier, storage, and usage. Consider database optimization techniques to minimize costs.

4. **Application Hosting**:
   - Deploy your Rails GraphQL backend on a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) like Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, or use container orchestration tools like Kubernetes. PaaS platforms abstract infrastructure management and provide scalability. Costs can vary based on resource usage.

5. **Serverless Architecture**:
   - Consider serverless solutions like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions for specific tasks, such as image and video processing, as they offer cost savings by charging only for actual usage.

6. **Monitoring and Optimization**:
   - Implement cost monitoring and optimization strategies. Use cloud provider tools or third-party services to track resource usage and costs, and periodically review and adjust your infrastructure to minimize unnecessary expenses.

7. **Free Tier and Credits**:
   - Leverage cloud provider free tiers and startup credits, especially during the development and testing phases. AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure offer free tiers and credit programs for new users.

8. **Open Source and Third-party Tools**:
   - Explore open-source tools and gems for optimizing your Rails application. Tools like `rack-mini-profiler` and `bullet` can help identify and improve performance bottlenecks.

9. **Reserve Instances**:
   - If you're using a cloud provider, consider using reserved instances or sustained use commitments for significant cost savings on compute resources.

10. **Financial Forecasting**:
    - Create a financial forecast for your application, taking into account projected usage, data storage, and other infrastructure costs. This can help you plan and budget effectively.

When it comes to choosing a cloud provider, the "best deal" depends on factors like your specific requirements, geographic location, and the availability of data centers. AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure are major providers, each with its own strengths and pricing models. You may want to compare their offerings and consider factors like data center locations, services, and pricing.

Remember that cloud costs are variable and depend on actual usage. Regularly monitor your usage and adjust your infrastructure as needed to manage costs efficiently while delivering a high-quality experience to your users.
