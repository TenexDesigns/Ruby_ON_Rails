In a Rails API application, you can handle and store different types of data including audio, documents, images, videos, files, and folders. Rails provides Active Storage for handling such files. Active Storage facilitates uploading files to a cloud storage service like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Microsoft Azure Storage and attaching those files to Active Record objects [Source 12](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html).

Here are some examples of how to handle file uploads with Active Storage:

1. To attach a file to a record, you first need to set up a many-to-one relationship between records and files. In your model, you can use the `has_one_attached` or `has_many_attached` methods to define this relationship:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_one_attached :avatar
  has_many_attached :documents
end
```

2. In your controller, you can handle file uploads in the create or update actions using the `params` hash:

```ruby
def create
  @user = User.new(user_params)

  if @user.save
    # Attach the uploaded avatar to the user
    @user.avatar.attach(params[:avatar])
    # Attach multiple uploaded documents to the user
    @user.documents.attach(params[:documents])
    render json: @user, status: :created
  else
    render json: @user.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity
  end
end
```

3. To retrieve the attached files, you can use the `avatar` and `documents` methods on the user object:

```ruby
def show
  @user = User.find(params[:id])
  avatar_url = url_for(@user.avatar) if @user.avatar.attached?
  document_urls = @user.documents.map { |document| url_for(document) } if @user.documents.attached?
  render json: { user: @user, avatar_url: avatar_url, document_urls: document_urls }
end
```

As for storing the data, Rails uses Active Record as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) layer to interact with the database. Each model in Rails corresponds to a table in the database. The data types that can be used for model attributes in Rails include: `:string`, `:text`, `:integer`, `:float`, `:decimal`, `:datetime`, `:timestamp`, `:time`, `:date`, `:binary`, `:boolean` [Source 22](https://marketsplash.com/tutorials/ruby-on-rails/ruby-on-rails-models/), [Source 25](https://dev.to/asyraf/rails-activerecord-data-types-32ip).

For example, if you have a User model with attributes like name (string), email (string), and age (integer), you can define it like this:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  # validations
  validates :name, :email, :age, presence: true
  validates :email, uniqueness: true
  validates :age, numericality: { greater_than_or_equal_to: 18 }

  # associations
  has_one_attached :avatar
  has_many_attached :documents
end
```

In the migration file, you can define the data types for these attributes:

```ruby
create_table :users do |t|
  t.string :name
  t.string :email
  t.integer :age

  t.timestamps
end
```

In the controller, you can create a new user and attach the uploaded files to the user:

```ruby
def create
  @user = User.new(user_params)

  if @user.save
    @user.avatar.attach(params[:avatar])
    @user.documents.attach(params[:documents])
    render json: @user, status: :created
  else
    render json: @user.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity
  end
end

private

def user_params
  params.require(:user).permit(:name, :email, :age)
end
```

In conclusion, a Rails API application can handle various types of data and store them using Active Record and Active Storage. You can define models to map to database tables, attach files to model instances, and perform CRUD operations on the data.
