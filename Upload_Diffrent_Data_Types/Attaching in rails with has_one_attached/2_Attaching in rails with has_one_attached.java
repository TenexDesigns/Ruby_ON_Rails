In the context of Active Storage in Ruby on Rails, "attaching" refers to associating a file with a specific record in the database. When a file is attached to a record, it means that the file is stored in a storage service (like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Microsoft Azure Storage), and the record in the database includes a reference to the file in the storage service.

The types of data that can be attached include any type of file, such as images, audio files, videos, PDFs, or any other type of binary data.

Uploading the data that needs to be attached is typically done through a form in a web page. The form includes a file input field that allows the user to select a file from their computer. When the form is submitted, the file is uploaded to the server and then passed to Active Storage, which stores the file in the configured storage service and attaches it to the specified record.

The `has_one_attached` and `has_many_attached` methods are used in Rails models to define the attachment relationship between the model and the files. 

- `has_one_attached` is used when a record should have one attached file. For example, a User model might use `has_one_attached` to attach an avatar image to each user.

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_one_attached :avatar
end
```

- `has_many_attached` is used when a record should have many attached files. For example, a Message model might use `has_many_attached` to attach many images to each message.

```ruby
class Message < ApplicationRecord
  has_many_attached :images
end
```

In both cases, the argument to the method (`:avatar` or `:images` in the examples) is the name of the attachment. This name is used to refer to the attachment in the rest of the application.
