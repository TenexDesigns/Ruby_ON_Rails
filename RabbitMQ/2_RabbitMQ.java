RabbitMQ is a message broker that lets your applications communicate with each other by sending messages in a fault-tolerant and reliable way. It can be particularly useful in a microservices architecture where multiple services need to communicate and share data.

Here's how you can set up RabbitMQ in a Rails GraphQL API microservice:

### Step 1: Install RabbitMQ

Firstly, you need to install RabbitMQ on your system. If you're using Ubuntu, you can do this with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server
```

For other operating systems, you can follow the instructions provided on the official [RabbitMQ website](https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html).

### Step 2: Install Bunny Gem

Bunny is a RabbitMQ client for Ruby. Add it to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'bunny'
```

Then run `bundle install`.

### Step 3: Establish a connection with RabbitMQ

Now you can establish a connection to RabbitMQ in your Rails application:

```ruby
require 'bunny'

connection = Bunny.new
connection.start
```

### Step 4: Create a channel and a queue

Next, create a channel and a queue:

```ruby
channel = connection.create_channel
queue = channel.queue('my_queue')
```

### Step 5: Publish a message to the queue

You can publish a message to the queue like this:

```ruby
channel.default_exchange.publish('Hello, world!', routing_key: queue.name)
```

### Step 6: Consume the message

Finally, you can consume the message:

```ruby
queue.subscribe(block: true) do |_delivery_info, _properties, body|
  puts "Received #{body}"
end
```

This will print 'Hello, world!' to the console.

### Using RabbitMQ in a GraphQL API Microservice

In the context of a Rails GraphQL API microservice, you can use RabbitMQ to communicate between different services. For example, when a mutation is performed in one service, it can publish a message to a RabbitMQ queue. Then, another service can consume this message and perform the necessary action.

Remember to close the connection when you're done:

```ruby
connection.close
```

This is a basic example of how to use RabbitMQ in a Rails application. Depending on your needs, you might want to use different exchanges, bind queues to exchanges, handle message acknowledgments, etc.
