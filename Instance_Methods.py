Instance methods in Rails are methods defined on an instance of a class.
They can be called on an instance of the class and have access to the instance variables within that instance.
Here is an example of an instance method in Rails:

class User < ApplicationRecord
  def full_name
    "#{first_name} #{last_name}"
  end
end
In this example, full_name is an instance method that returns the full name of a user, 
which is a combination of the first_name and last_name attributes of the User object. 
This method can be called on an instance of the User class and has access to the instance variables first_name and last_name.

Its important to note that instance methods can only be called on an instance of a class and not on the class itself. 
In contrast, class methods are defined on the class itself and can only be called on the class.

In summary, instance methods in Rails are methods that are defined on an instance of a class and can be called on that instance.
They have access to the instance variables within that instance.
Its important to note that instance methods can only be called on an instance of a class and not on the class itself.
