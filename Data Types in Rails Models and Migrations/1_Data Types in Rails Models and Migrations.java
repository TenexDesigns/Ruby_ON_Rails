In Rails migrations and models, you can use various data types to define the structure of your database tables and the attributes of your models. The supported data types can vary depending on the database system you are using. Here are some common data types available in Rails migrations and models:

**Common Data Types in Rails Migrations:**

1. **integer:** Represents a whole number (e.g., 1, 42).

2. **float:** Represents a floating-point number with decimal places (e.g., 3.14).

3. **decimal:** Represents a fixed-point number with a specified precision and scale (e.g., decimal(8, 2)).

4. **string:** Represents a character string with a variable length.

5. **text:** Represents a long text field for storing large amounts of text data.

6. **boolean:** Represents a true or false value (typically used for boolean fields).

7. **date:** Represents a date without a time (e.g., 2023-11-01).

8. **datetime:** Represents a date and time (e.g., 2023-11-01 15:30:00).

9. **time:** Represents a time of day (e.g., 15:30:00).

10. **timestamp:** Represents a date and time (similar to datetime).

11. **binary:** Represents binary data (e.g., images or files).

12. **references:** Represents a foreign key to another table and is used to define associations between models.

13. **primary_key:** Specifies the primary key of the table.

14. **citext:** A case-insensitive text data type (available in some databases).

15. **uuid:** Represents a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID).

16. **json:** Represents JSON data.

17. **jsonb:** Represents binary JSON data (available in some databases).

18. **enum:** Represents an enumerated list of values (available in some databases).

**Data Types in Rails Models:**

In Rails models, data types are used to define the attributes or fields of a model. You can use the same data types as in migrations, and you can also use additional data types specific to your application logic.

For example, when defining attributes in a model using the `rails generate model` command, you can specify data types like `string`, `integer`, `text`, and others:

```bash
rails generate model Post title:string body:text
```

Here, `title` is of type `string`, and `body` is of type `text`.

**Database Compatibility:**

The availability of data types can vary depending on the database system you are using. Rails supports multiple databases, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and others. Each database may have its own set of data
