Here are the different data types that you can use in Rails migrations and models, and whether or not they are dependent on the database used:

Data type            	Migration	            Model            	Postgres
  
String	              t.string	            string	          Yes
Text	                t.text	              text	            Yes
Integer	              t.integer	            integer	          Yes
Float	                t.float	              float	            Yes
Decimal	              t.decimal	            decimal	          Yes
Boolean	              t.boolean	            boolean	          Yes
DateTime	            t.datetime	          datetime	        Yes
Date	                t.date  	            date	            Yes
Time	                t.time	              time	            Yes
Reference	            t.references	        belongs_to        Yes
                                            or has_many


  
As you can see, all of the data types that you can use in Rails migrations and models are supported by PostgreSQL. However, there are some database-specific data types that you can use in migrations, such as uuid in PostgreSQL.

Here are some examples of database-specific data types in PostgreSQL:

Data type             	Migration             	Model             	Postgres
  
UUID	                  t.uuid	                uuid	              Yes
ENUM	                  t.enum	                enum	              Yes
HSTORE	                t.hstore	              hstore	            Yes

  
If you need to use a database-specific data type in a migration, you can use the t.type method. For example, to create a uuid column, you would use the following code:


t.type     :uuid,       using: :uuid

You can also use the t.type method to create custom data types. For example, to create a json column, you would use the following code:

t.type :json, using: :jsonb

Please note that custom data types may not be supported by all databases.

I hope this helps!
