Action View is the component in Rails responsible for handling the presentation layer of your application.
It deals with generating HTML, rendering templates, and providing helper methods for building user interfaces.
Action View follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern and works closely with the ActionController and ActiveRecord components.
Lets explore the key aspects of Action View:

Templates and Rendering:
Action View uses templates to generate the HTML that is sent to the browser. 
Templates can be written in various formats such as ERB (Embedded Ruby), Haml, Slim, etc. 
These templates are typically stored in the app/views directory of your Rails application.
Action View provides methods to render these templates, allowing you to generate dynamic 
content based on the data passed from the controller.

Layouts:
Layouts define the overall structure and shared components of your applications views. 
They allow you to define a common structure, such as headers, footers, and navigation menus, 
that is used across multiple pages. Layouts can be defined as a single file or can be nested using content placeholders.

Partial Rendering:
Action View supports partial rendering, which allows you to extract reusable components from your views.
Partials are smaller, self-contained views that can be rendered within other views.
They promote code reusability and maintainability by encapsulating specific UI elements or sections of a view.

Helpers:
Action View provides a range of helper methods that assist in generating HTML, working with forms,
handling URLs, and more. These helper methods make it easier to generate complex HTML structures,
handle form submissions, generate links, and perform other common view-related tasks.

Form Builders:
Action View includes form builders that simplify the process of creating and handling HTML forms.
Form builders provide helper methods for generating form fields, handling form submissions,
and performing form validations. They also assist with handling security features like CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection.

Asset Pipeline:
Action View works in conjunction with the asset pipeline to manage and serve static assets such as stylesheets,
JavaScript files, and images. The asset pipeline handles tasks like precompiling assets, 
managing asset dependencies, and caching to improve performance.

Action View plays a crucial role in building the user interface of your Rails application. 
It provides the tools and conventions to generate dynamic HTML, render templates, handle forms,
and create reusable UI components. By leveraging the features provided by Action View, 
you can create elegant and interactive user experiences in your Rails application.
