Action View is the component in Rails responsible for handling the presentation layer of your application.
It deals with generating HTML, rendering templates, and providing helper methods for building user interfaces.
Action View follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern and works closely with the ActionController and ActiveRecord components.
Lets explore the key aspects of Action View:

Templates and Rendering:
Action View uses templates to generate the HTML that is sent to the browser. 
Templates can be written in various formats such as ERB (Embedded Ruby), Haml, Slim, etc. 
These templates are typically stored in the app/views directory of your Rails application.
Action View provides methods to render these templates, allowing you to generate dynamic 
content based on the data passed from the controller.

Layouts:
Layouts define the overall structure and shared components of your applications views. 
They allow you to define a common structure, such as headers, footers, and navigation menus, 
that is used across multiple pages. Layouts can be defined as a single file or can be nested using content placeholders.

Partial Rendering:
Action View supports partial rendering, which allows you to extract reusable components from your views.
Partials are smaller, self-contained views that can be rendered within other views.
They promote code reusability and maintainability by encapsulating specific UI elements or sections of a view.

Helpers:
Action View provides a range of helper methods that assist in generating HTML, working with forms,
handling URLs, and more. These helper methods make it easier to generate complex HTML structures,
handle form submissions, generate links, and perform other common view-related tasks.

Form Builders:
Action View includes form builders that simplify the process of creating and handling HTML forms.
Form builders provide helper methods for generating form fields, handling form submissions,
and performing form validations. They also assist with handling security features like CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection.

Asset Pipeline:
Action View works in conjunction with the asset pipeline to manage and serve static assets such as stylesheets,
JavaScript files, and images. The asset pipeline handles tasks like precompiling assets, 
managing asset dependencies, and caching to improve performance.

Action View plays a crucial role in building the user interface of your Rails application. 
It provides the tools and conventions to generate dynamic HTML, render templates, handle forms,
and create reusable UI components. By leveraging the features provided by Action View, 
you can create elegant and interactive user experiences in your Rails application.

Action View is a framework in Rails that is responsible for handling view template lookup and rendering.
It is one of the main components of Rails, along with Action Controller, and is responsible for compiling the response.
Here are some key aspects of Action View:

Embedded Ruby: Action View templates are written using embedded Ruby in tags mingled with HTML. 
  This allows developers to include Ruby code directly in the HTML, making it easier to generate dynamic content.
<p><%= @post.title %></p>
In this example, the embedded Ruby code @post.title is used to display the title of a blog post.

View Helpers: To avoid cluttering the templates with boilerplate code,
  Action View provides a number of helper classes that provide common behavior for forms, dates,
  and strings. These helpers can be used to generate HTML code more easily and efficiently.
  
<%= form_with(model: @post) do |f| %>
  <%= f.label :title %>
  <%= f.text_field :title %>
  <%= f.label :body %>
  <%= f.text_area :body %>
  <%= f.submit %>
<% end %>
In this example, the form_with helper is used to generate an HTML form for a blog post.
The helper takes a model object (@post) as an argument, which is used to generate the appropriate form fields.

Template Formats: Action View can handle multiple template formats, 
  including ERB (embedded Ruby) and XML Builder. 
  This allows developers to generate different types of content depending on the needs of their application.
  
# app/views/posts/index.html.erb
<h1>Posts</h1>
<% @posts.each do |post| %>
  <h2><%= post.title %></h2>
  <p><%= post.body %></p>
<% end %>

# app/views/posts/index.xml.builder
xml.posts do
  @posts.each do |post|
    xml.post do
      xml.title post.title
      xml.body post.body
    end
  end
end
In this example, two different templates are used to display a
list of blog posts: one in HTML format and one in XML format.

In summary, Action View is a framework in Rails that is responsible for handling view template lookup and rendering.
It uses embedded Ruby to generate dynamic content, provides view helpers to simplify HTML generation,
and can handle multiple template formats.
