The explanation you provided is accurate. Whether to use Rails' built-in parameters (from the `params` hash) or a gem like `jsonapi-serializer` for deserialization depends on your specific needs and the complexity of the data you are handling.

**Using Params for Deserialization:**

- If you are working with simple data structures where the JSON payload corresponds directly to your database model's attributes, using the `params` hash is straightforward and efficient.

- This approach is suitable for cases where you don't need to enforce a strict JSON:API format for incoming data, and the data structure is relatively straightforward.

**Using `jsonapi-serializer` for Deserialization:**

- If you are working with complex objects that have many attributes and relationships, and you want to enforce a specific JSON:API format for incoming data, then using a gem like `jsonapi-serializer` can be beneficial.

- `jsonapi-serializer` and similar gems can help you handle more complex scenarios, including relationships, metadata, and other aspects of the JSON:API specification. They provide additional validation and transformation capabilities.

**Recommendation:**

The choice of whether to use `params` or a gem like `jsonapi-serializer` for deserialization depends on the complexity of your data and your project requirements.

- If you are working with relatively simple data structures, using `params` is often the simplest and most efficient approach.

- If your API requires strict adherence to the JSON:API format, and you are dealing with complex data structures with numerous attributes and relationships, using `jsonapi-serializer` can make the deserialization process easier, more organized, and less error-prone.

Ultimately, the choice depends on the specific needs of your application and the level of complexity you are dealing with. If your project involves complex relationships, nested data, and adherence to the JSON:API specification, a gem like `jsonapi-serializer` can be a valuable tool. However, for simpler use cases, using `params` may be more straightforward and efficient.
