To use the AWS CLI to deploy a Rails backend API app with Elastic Beanstalk, set up the database, and perform other AWS-related tasks as discussed in your provided context, you can follow these steps. Please note that this is a high-level overview based on the context you provided. You should adapt it to your specific application and requirements.

1. **Install the AWS CLI**:
   - If you haven't already, install the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) on your Windows machine. You can use the instructions provided earlier in your context for macOS or Linux, but you need to install it for Windows.

2. **Configure AWS Credentials**:
   - Run `aws configure` in your Windows command prompt or terminal.
   - Follow the prompts to enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region, and output format.
   - Ensure that you provide correct and valid AWS credentials.

3. **Initialize Elastic Beanstalk App**:
   - Navigate to the root folder of your Rails app using the command prompt.
   - Run `eb init` to initialize your Elastic Beanstalk application.
   - Choose the default region or specify the region you want to use.
   - Provide your AWS credentials when prompted.
   - Create a new Elastic Beanstalk application.
   - Name your application (e.g., "tandibi").

4. **Configure Elastic Beanstalk Environment**:
   - Choose "Web server environment" when asked about the environment tier.
   - Name your environment (e.g., "tandibi-production-env").
   - Select the desired platform (e.g., Puma with Ruby 2.6).
   - Choose whether to set up SSH for your instances (likely "Y").
   - Create a new key pair and set a password for it.

5. **Check Elastic Beanstalk Configuration**:
   - Verify your Elastic Beanstalk environment configuration using the `eb status` command.

6. **Set Up the Database**:
   - Access the AWS RDS (Relational Database Service) management console.
   - Create a new PostgreSQL database instance. Choose the "Free tier" option for the instance size.
   - Configure the connectivity settings to make your database publicly available (not recommended for production use).
   - Note the database endpoint for later use.

7. **Configure Database Security Group**:
   - Access the security group settings for your RDS instance.
   - Edit inbound rules to allow incoming connections. Add a rule with source `0.0.0.0/0` to allow HTTP connections.
   - Save the rule settings.

Please keep in mind that AWS services and their configurations can be complex, and security considerations are critical. The steps provided here are a high-level overview, and you should refer to the AWS documentation and follow best practices for security and resource management.
