To use the AWS CLI to deploy a Rails backend API app to Elastic Beanstalk using Docker and a relational database on Amazon RDS, you will need to follow these steps:

1. **Install the AWS CLI for Windows.**
2. **Create a Docker image for your Rails app.**
3. **Create an RDS database instance.**
4. **Update your app's configuration to connect to the database.**
5. **Create an Elastic Beanstalk application.**
6. **Deploy your app to Elastic Beanstalk.**

Here are the detailed steps for each step:

**1. Install the AWS CLI for Windows.**

You can download the latest version of the AWS CLI for Windows from the AWS website: https://aws.amazon.com/cli/

**2. Create a Docker image for your Rails app.**

To create a Docker image for your Rails app, you can use the following Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
FROM ruby:2.6

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential

WORKDIR /app

COPY Gemfile* .

RUN bundle install

COPY . .

CMD ["rails", "server"]
```

To build the Docker image, run the following command:

```
docker build -t my-rails-app .
```

**3. Create an RDS database instance.**

To create an RDS database instance, you can use the AWS Console or the AWS CLI.

To create an RDS database instance using the AWS Console, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Amazon RDS console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/
2. Click **Create database**.
3. Select **Standard Create**.
4. Select a database engine, such as PostgreSQL or MySQL.
5. Select an instance class.
6. Specify a database identifier.
7. Specify a master username and password.
8. Click **Create database**.

To create an RDS database instance using the AWS CLI, run the following command:


aws rds create-db-instance --allocated-storage 20 --db-instance-class db.t2.micro --engine PostgreSQL --master-username postgres --master-password mypassword


**4. Update your app's configuration to connect to the database.**

To update your app's configuration to connect to the database, you will need to add the database connection credentials to your app's environment variables. For example, if you are using PostgreSQL, you will need to add the following environment variables to your app's Gemfile:

```ruby
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:mypassword@my-rds-instance.amazonaws.com:5432/my-database"
```

**5. Create an Elastic Beanstalk application.**

To create an Elastic Beanstalk application, you can use the AWS Console or the AWS CLI.

To create an Elastic Beanstalk application using the AWS Console, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Elastic Beanstalk console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/
2. Click **Create application**.
3. Enter an application name.
4. Select a platform, such as Ruby on Rails.
5. Select an application template.
6. Click **Create application**.

To create an Elastic Beanstalk application using the AWS CLI, run the following command:


aws elasticbeanstalk create-application --application-name my-rails-app --platform arn:aws:elasticbeanstalk:us-east-1::platform/ruby/2.6


**6. Deploy your app to Elastic Beanstalk.**

Once you have created your Elastic Beanstalk application, you can deploy your app to it using the following steps:

1. Create a new Elastic Beanstalk environment.
2. Select the **Docker** platform.
3. Select your Docker image.
4. Select your database instance.
5. Click **Create environment**.

Once your environment is created, Elastic Beanstalk will deploy your app to it. You can then access your app using the CNAME that is generated by Elastic Beanstalk. For example, if your app's CNAME is `my-app.example.com`, you can access it at that address in your web browser.

I hope this information is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
