The code samples you provided are from the book *A Well-Rounded Engineer* by Jon Duckett. They show how to use the AWS CLI to create and deploy a Rails backend API app to Elastic Beanstalk, using a relational database on Amazon RDS.

To implement these code samples on Windows, you will need to install the AWS CLI for Windows. Once the AWS CLI is installed, you can follow the instructions in the book to create and deploy your app.

Here is a brief summary of the steps involved:

1. Initialize your app for deployment to Elastic Beanstalk using the `eb init` command.
2. Choose a platform and create a new application environment.
3. Set up SSH for your instances.
4. Create a new database on Amazon RDS.
5. Update your app's configuration to connect to the database.
6. Deploy your app to Elastic Beanstalk using the `eb deploy` command.

Once your app is deployed, you can access it using the CNAME that is generated by Elastic Beanstalk. For example, if your app's CNAME is `my-app.example.com`, you can access it at that address in your web browser.

**Note:** The book you are quoting from recommends using Docker to deploy to Elastic Beanstalk. However, you can also deploy your app without using Docker, as shown in the code samples you provided.

**Here are some additional tips for implementing these code samples on Windows:**

* Make sure that you are using the latest version of the AWS CLI.
* If you are using a proxy server, you may need to configure the AWS CLI to use it.
* When you create a new database on Amazon RDS, be sure to choose a region that is compatible with your Elastic Beanstalk environment.
* When you update your app's configuration to connect to the database, be sure to use the correct database endpoint and credentials.
* When you deploy your app to Elastic Beanstalk, be sure to specify the correct application environment.

I hope this information is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
