In Rails routing, member and collection routes are used to define additional custom routes
that are specific to individual resources (member routes) or multiple resources (collection routes).
Lets explore the concepts of member and collection routes in more detail with code samples:

Member Routes:
Member routes are custom routes that are associated with a specific resource instance.
These routes typically operate on a single resource record and include the 
resources identifier (such as ID) in the URL. Here's an example of defining a member route:

resources :users do
  member do
    get 'profile'
    post 'follow'
  end
end

In this example, we define member routes for the users resource.
The member block is used to define routes that operate on an individual user.
The profile route represents the users profile page, and the follow route allows a user to be followed.

The generated URLs for member routes will include the resources identifier, such as /users/1/profile or /users/1/follow.

Collection Routes:
Collection routes, on the other hand, are custom routes that operate on a collection of resources.
These routes do not require the resources identifier in the URL. Heres an example:


resources :users do
  collection do
    get 'popular'
    get 'search'
  end
end

In this example, we define collection routes for the users resource. 
The collection block is used to define routes that operate on the entire collection of users.
The popular route represents a list of popular users, and the search route allows searching for users.

The generated URLs for collection routes will not include the resources identifier, such as /users/popular or /users/search.

Usage and Benefits:
Member and collection routes provide a way to add custom actions and URLs to your resources.
They allow you to define specific routes that operate on individual or multiple resource records.
These routes can be used for actions that dont fit the standard RESTful CRUD operations or require 
additional functionality specific to a resource instance or the entire collection.

Member and collection routes can be useful when you need to add custom actions like profile pages,
follow/unfollow functionality, search, sorting, filtering,
or any other specialized operations that go beyond the standard CRUD actions.

By utilizing member and collection routes, you can extend the default resourceful routes provided
by Rails and define additional routes tailored to your applications requirements.
They provide flexibility and customization options while still maintaining the benefits of RESTful routing conventions.
