System design is the process of defining the architecture, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It's crucial in the software engineering process as it helps developers understand the system's functionality and architecture before starting the actual coding. 

The system design process for a cooking app in Rails can be broken down into several components:

1. **User Management Microservice**: Handles user registration, authentication, profile management, and user followings. It can use PostgreSQL as its database because of its robust support for relational data and ACID transactions.

2. **Post Management Microservice**: Manages the creation, updating, and retrieval of posts, including videos, recipes, and pictures. Given the heavy write operations and the nature of the data, Cassandra would be a good choice for its database.

3. **Comments Microservice**: Manages user comments on posts. This could also use PostgreSQL.

4. **Notifications Microservice**: Sends notifications to users when there are new posts from creators they follow. This could use RabbitMQ for message queuing.

5. **Search Microservice**: Handles searching for posts, recipes, and users. You could use Elasticsearch for this.

6. **Frontend**: The user interface of your app. It communicates with the backend microservices through their APIs.

For each microservice, you'll have Rails models representing the main entities. For example, in the User Management Microservice, you might have a `User` model, in the Post Management Microservice, you might have a `Post` model, etc. These models would use ActiveRecord for PostgreSQL and the Cassandra driver for Cassandra.

Here's a simple example of a `User` model:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_secure_password

  validates :username, presence: true, uniqueness: true
  validates :email, presence: true, uniqueness: true, format: { with: URI::MailTo::EMAIL_REGEXP }

  has_many :posts
  has_many :comments
end
```

And here's a `Post` model:

```ruby
class Post
  include Cequel::Record

  key :id, :uuid, auto: true
  column :user_id, :uuid
  column :title, :text
  column :content, :text
  column :created_at, :timestamp
  column :updated_at, :timestamp

  belongs_to :user
  has_many :comments
end
```

For the frontend, you could use a modern JavaScript framework like React or Vue.js, or you could stick with Rails' built-in view layer.

Microservices will communicate with each other using HTTP/REST or gRPC. For asynchronous communication or for communication that should be handled in the background, RabbitMQ would be a good choice.

Remember, this is a high-level overview of the system design. The actual implementation might require more components and details depending on your specific requirements [Source 1](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v5.0/getting_started.html), [Source 3](https://www.varvet.com/blog/building-components-and-style-guides-in-rails/), [Source 4](https://rubygarage.org/blog/configuring-rails-app-on-ec2-with-chef-part-2), [Source 6](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html).
