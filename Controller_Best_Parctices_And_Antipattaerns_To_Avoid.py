Certainly! Here are some controller antipatterns to avoid in Rails, as well as some best practices to follow:

Controller Antipatterns to Avoid:

Fat Controllers:
  A "fat" controller is one that handles too much logic, making it difficult to maintain and test.
  Avoid putting business logic or complex calculations directly in the controller. 
  Instead, move such logic to the model or use service objects to encapsulate it.

Lack of RESTful Design:
  Rails encourages RESTful design principles.
  Avoid creating non-RESTful routes and actions unless you have a specific reason to deviate 
  from the standard RESTful conventions. Stick to the conventional CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) whenever possible.

Violating Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
  Controllers should have a single responsibility, which is handling requests and generating responses.
  Avoid mixing unrelated functionality in a single controller.
  Extract related logic into separate classes like models or service objects.

Overuse of Instance Variables: While instance variables are commonly used to pass data from controllers to views,
be cautious not to overuse them. Limit the use of instance variables to only the data necessary for the view and
consider alternative approaches like presenters or view models for complex view-related logic.







Controller Best Practices to Follow:

Keep Actions Simple and Focused: 
  Each action in a controller should have a clear and specific purpose. 
  It should handle a single task and be concise. If an action becomes too complex, extract the logic into separate methods 
  or move it to the model layer.

Use Strong Parameters:
  When accepting user input, use strong parameters to whitelist and sanitize the permitted attributes.
  This helps prevent mass assignment vulnerabilities and ensures that only the intended attributes are accepted from forms 
  or API requests.

Utilize Filters and Callbacks:
  Rails provides filters and callbacks, such as before_action, 
  after_action, and around_action, to perform common tasks before, after, or around controller actions.
  Use these hooks to encapsulate repetitive tasks like authentication, authorization, or setting up variables.

Test Controller Actions: Write tests for your controller actions to ensure proper behavior and catch regressions.
  Use tools like RSpec or MiniTest to write unit tests that cover different scenarios and edge cases.

Keep Controllers Thin: Follow the "Skinny Controller, Fat Model" principle. 
  Keep your controllers lean and delegate most of the business logic to the model layer.
  Controllers should mainly orchestrate interactions between models, views, and services.

Apply RESTful Routing: Adhere to RESTful routing principles provided by Rails.
  Use the appropriate HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) for the corresponding actions 
  (index, show, new, create, edit, update, destroy). This promotes consistency and readability in your codebase.

By following these best practices, you can ensure cleaner, more maintainable, and testable controller code in your Rails applications.

Based on the provided sources, here are some Rails controller anti-patterns to avoid and best practices to adhere to:

Anti-patterns to avoid:

Large, monolithic controllers: Controllers should be small and focused on a single responsibility.
  If a controller is handling too many actions, consider splitting it into smaller controllers or
  using a different design pattern, such as Service Objects or Presenters.
blog.appsignal.com

Mixing business logic with controllers: Controllers should be responsible for handling user requests
  and delegating tasks to models and services. Avoid putting complex business logic directly in controllers.
blog.appsignal.com

Inappropriate use of session and global variables: Controllers should not rely on global variables or
  session data to store temporary information. Instead, use instance variables, local variables, or pass data explicitly through methods.
blog.appsignal.com

Best practices to adhere to:

Use RESTful conventions: Follow the RESTful conventions for naming and organizing controller actions,
  such as using index, show, new, create, edit, update, and destroy as action names.

Keep controllers focused on a single resource: Controllers should be responsible for handling actions
  related to a single resource or a single responsibility. If a controller is handling actions for multiple resources,
  consider splitting it into smaller controllers.
blog.appsignal.com

Use strong parameters: Always use strong parameters in your controllers to prevent mass assignment vulnerabilities
  and ensure that only the expected parameters are passed to your models.
blog.appsignal.com

Use service objects or other design patterns: Instead of handling complex business logic in controllers,
  consider using service objects or other design patterns like presenters to keep your controllers clean and f
  ocused on handling user requests.
blog.appsignal.com

Use before_action and after_action callbacks: Use before_action and after_action callbacks in your
  controllers to perform common tasks, such as authentication, caching, or logging, across multiple actions.
blog.appsignal.com

Keep controllers skinny: Controllers should be small and focused on handling user requests. 
  Avoid putting too much code in controllers, and instead, delegate tasks to models, services, or other components.
blog.appsignal.com

Follow Rails conventions and best practices: Always follow Rails conventions and best practices, 
  such as organizing your code in the app/controllers directory, using the application.rb file to include all controllers,
  and using the rails_helper to generate helper methods for your controllers.

Sure. Here are some controller antipatterns to avoid in Rails:

Not using model validations. Model validations are a great way to prevent bad data from entering your database.
If you don't use model validations, you'll have to do all of the validation in your controller, 
which can be error-prone and time-consuming.
Not using strong parameters. Strong parameters are a way to restrict the data that can be passed to your controller actions. 
This helps to prevent security vulnerabilities.
Not using helper methods. Helper methods are a way to encapsulate common code in one place. 
This makes your code more readable and maintainable.
Not using partials. Partials are a way to reuse code in your views. 
This makes your code more DRY and easier to maintain.
Not using the asset pipeline. The asset pipeline is a way to compile and minify your assets, 
which can improve the performance of your application.
