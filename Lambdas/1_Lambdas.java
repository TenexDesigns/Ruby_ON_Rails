Ruby, the programming language on which Ruby on Rails is based, does not have arrow functions like those in JavaScript. However, Ruby has its own way of defining lambdas and blocks, which are somewhat similar to JavaScript's arrow functions and function expressions.

Here's an overview of how lambdas and blocks work in Ruby and how they are used in Ruby on Rails:

**Lambdas**:

In Ruby, lambdas are a way to define anonymous functions that can be stored in variables and passed around as objects. They are similar to JavaScript's arrow functions in that they have a more concise syntax compared to full methods. Here's how you define a lambda in Ruby:

```ruby
my_lambda = lambda { |param1, param2| param1 + param2 }
result = my_lambda.call(2, 3) # Calling the lambda
```

Lambdas are often used in Ruby on Rails when you need to pass a block of code to a method, create custom validations, or for other functional programming purposes.

**Blocks**:

Blocks are similar to lambdas but are typically associated with methods. They are often used to define custom iteration and behavior for methods. In Ruby on Rails, blocks are frequently used with methods like `each`, `map`, and `find` for working with collections:

```ruby
[1, 2, 3].each do |num|
  puts num
end
```

Rails often leverages blocks when defining routes, as well as in other areas where custom behavior needs to be specified.

Here's an example of using a block to define a route in a Rails application's `config/routes.rb` file:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  resources :posts do
    get 'custom_action', on: :member do
      # Custom behavior for this action
    end
  end
end
```

In this example, the block specifies custom behavior for the `custom_action` route.

While Ruby does not have arrow functions like JavaScript, it provides its own mechanisms for defining and using lambdas and blocks. These constructs are essential in Ruby and Ruby on Rails for creating custom functions, defining behavior, and working with collections.
