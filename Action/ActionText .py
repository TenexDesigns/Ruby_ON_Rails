ActionText is a feature in Ruby on Rails that provides a rich text editing experience by integrating the Trix editor into your application. It allows users to write and format content with features like bold, italic, lists, images, and more.

To use ActionText in your Rails application, you need to follow these steps:

Configure Active Storage: ActionText relies on Active Storage to handle file attachments. Make sure you have set up Active Storage as described in the previous explanation.

Generate ActionText migrations: Run the following command to generate the necessary migrations for ActionText:

bash
Copy code
rails action_text:install
This command will create migrations to add the action_text_rich_texts and action_text_rich_text_versions tables to your database.

Run the migrations: Apply the generated migrations by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
rails db:migrate
Associate ActionText with your models: In the model where you want to use ActionText, add the has_rich_text method to define the association. For example, if you have a Post model:

ruby
Copy code
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  has_rich_text :content
end
This code adds a rich text association named content to the Post model.

Update your forms to include the ActionText editor. For example, in your form to create or edit a post:

erb
Copy code
<%= form_with(model: @post, local: true) do |form| %>
  <!-- Other form fields -->
  <%= form.rich_text_area :content %>
  <%= form.submit %>
<% end %>
The rich_text_area helper generates a text area with the Trix editor for the content attribute.

Display rich text content in your views: To display the rich text content in your views, you can use the rich_text_area method. For example, to display the content of a post:

erb
Copy code
<%= @post.content %>
This will render the HTML representation of the rich text content.

ActionText simplifies the process of adding rich text editing capabilities to your Rails application. It handles the storage of the content, including any images or attachments, and provides an intuitive editing experience for your users.
