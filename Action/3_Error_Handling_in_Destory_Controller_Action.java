In Rails, you can handle exceptions in your controllers using `begin`/`rescue` blocks. Here's an example of how you might handle exceptions in the `destroy` action of a controller:

```ruby
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  # DELETE /users/:id
  def destroy
    begin
      user = User.find(params[:id])
      user.destroy
      render json: { message: 'User successfully deleted' }, status: :ok
    rescue ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound => e
      render json: { error: 'User not found' }, status: :not_found
    rescue => e
      render json: { error: 'Failed to delete User' }, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  end
end
```

In this example, we're using a `begin`/`rescue` block to handle exceptions when trying to find and destroy a user.

- If the user is found and successfully destroyed, we return a success message with a status of `:ok` (HTTP 200).
- If the user is not found (`ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound` is raised), we return an error message with a status of `:not_found` (HTTP 404).
- If any other error occurs, we return a generic error message with a status of `:unprocessable_entity` (HTTP 422).

This is a simple example and in a real-world application, you might want to handle different types of errors differently. For example, if the error is due to a violation of a database constraint, you might want to return a different error message and status code.
