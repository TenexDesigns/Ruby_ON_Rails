Think of a migration as a schema version of your file
The last migration you run for your application, represents the schema version of your application.






Schema versioning in Rails refers to the mechanism used to track and manage the version of the database schema
used by a Rails application. It ensures that the database schema is kept in sync with the corresponding version of 
the applications code. Rails uses the concept of schema migrations to achieve schema versioning.

When you run migrations using ActiveRecord, Rails automatically maintains a table in the database called schema_migrations.
This table keeps track of the migrations that have been applied to the database.
Each migration file has a timestamp as its prefix, which represents the version of the migration.
When a migration is executed, its version is recorded in the schema_migrations table.

Heres an example of the schema_migrations table:

version
20220101000000
20220102000000
20220103000000
In the above example, three migrations have been applied to the database, each represented by its version.

Rails uses the db/schema.rb file to represent the current state of the database schema. 
This file is automatically generated and updated whenever you run migrations.
It includes the definition of the database tables, indexes, constraints, and other schema information.

To check the current version of the database schema, you can use the following command:

Copy code
rails db:version
This command will display the latest version recorded in the schema_migrations table.

To migrate the database to a specific version, you can use the following command:

php
Copy code
rails db:migrate VERSION=<desired_version>
This command will run the necessary migrations to reach the desired version.
It will apply any pending migrations if the version is higher than the current one or 
rollback migrations if the version is lower.

Schema versioning ensures that the database schema remains consistent with the application code,
allowing multiple developers to collaborate on a project and ensuring that the application can
be deployed and run with the correct schema on different environments.

Note that schema versioning in Rails is managed by ActiveRecord and is specific to Rails applications.
It may differ from other database schema versioning tools and approaches used in different frameworks or systems.

Schema versioning in Rails refers to the ability to version the database schema based on the Rails version. 
This allows existing applications to still load their database schemas generated in older versions of Rails,
with the same behavior as before, keeping it matching the production database schema. 
This feature was introduced in Rails 7.0.2 and is useful for making it easier to upgrade to newer versions
of Rails without having to migrate the database schema manually. [0]

When you create a new Rails application, the schema version is set to 0. However, as you create and run migrations,
the schema version is incremented automatically. This allows Rails to keep track of the current state of the database 
schema and apply any new changes that are made. [5]

Here are some key points to keep in mind about schema versioning in Rails:

When you run rails db:migrate, Rails checks the current schema version and applies 
  any new migrations that haven't been applied yet.
If you're upgrading from an older version of Rails, you can use the db:schema:load 
task to load the existing schema into the database. Rails will automatically detect the
schema version and apply any necessary migrations.
If you're downgrading to an older version of Rails, you may need to manually migrate the 
database schema to match the older version. This is because older versions of Rails may not be able to apply newer migrations.
You can view the current schema version by checking the schema_migrations table in the database. 
This table contains a list of all the migrations that have been applied, along with their version numbers.
In summary, schema versioning in Rails is a useful feature that allows you to version the database schema
based on the Rails version. This makes it easier to upgrade to newer versions of Rails without having
to migrate the database schema manually. When you run migrations, Rails automatically updates the schema v
ersion and applies any new changes. If youre upgrading to an older version of Rails,
you may need to manually migrate the database schema to match the older version.
