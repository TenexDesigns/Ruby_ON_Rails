In the provided code snippet:


class ProjectsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :set_project, only: %i[ show edit update destroy ]

  # GET /projects or /projects.json
  def index
    @projects = Project.all
  end
end

The @projects instance variable represents a collection of Project objects.
In the index action of the ProjectsController, @projects is assigned the value of Project.all, 
which fetches all the projects from the database.

By assigning @projects as an instance variable, it becomes accessible within the view associated with the index action. 
This allows the view to display or iterate over the collection of projects and present them to the user.

For example, if you have an index.html.erb view associated with the index action,
you can use the @projects variable to display the projects:


<!-- app/views/projects/index.html.erb -->
<h1>All Projects</h1>

<% @projects.each do |project| %>
  <h3><%= project.name %></h3>
  <p><%= project.description %></p>
<% end %>
In the above example, the @projects.each loop iterates over each Project object in the @projects collection
and displays the name and description of each project.

By making @projects an instance variable, it ensures that the data is accessible within the view and can be rendered dynamically.



The @prjects is an instance variable , and it can have any name
