To make your API endpoints require authentication using the bearer token provided in the "Authorization" header, you can use a combination of the `before_action` filter and the `devise_token_auth` gem's built-in authentication features.

Here's how you can protect your API endpoints with authentication in your Rails application:

1. **Configure Routes for Authentication**:

   In your `config/routes.rb` file, you can specify which endpoints should require authentication using the `authenticate` helper from `devise_token_auth`. For example:

   ```ruby
   namespace :v1 do
     mount_devise_token_auth_for 'User', at: 'auth'

     # Define your authenticated routes
     resources :items
   end
   ```

   In this example, the `resources :items` route is protected and will require authentication.

2. **Use `before_action` Filter**:

   In your controller, use a `before_action` filter to ensure that the endpoint is protected. You can add this filter at the beginning of your controller:

   ```ruby
   class V1::ItemsController < ApplicationController
     before_action :authenticate_user!

     # Your controller actions here
   end
   ```

   The `before_action :authenticate_user!` filter ensures that the user is authenticated before any actions in the controller are executed. If the user is not authenticated, they will receive a 401 Unauthorized response.

3. **Testing Authentication**:

   To test authentication, make sure you include the bearer token in the "Authorization" header when making requests. The token should be of the format "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" where `YOUR_TOKEN` is the actual token.

   For example, in a tool like cURL:

   ```bash
   curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost:3000/v1/items
   ```

   Replace `YOUR_TOKEN` with the actual token you received upon successful sign-in or registration.

By adding the `before_action :authenticate_user!` filter in your controller, only authenticated users with valid tokens will be able to access the protected endpoints. Unauthenticated users will receive a 401 Unauthorized response.















Is authenticate_user! method is provided by the devise_token_auth gem. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, you're correct. The `authenticate_user!` method is provided by the `devise_token_auth` gem. It's a part of the gem's built-in authentication system. When you use `before_action :authenticate_user!` in your controller, it ensures that the current request is authenticated and the user is signed in with a valid token.

Regarding your question about configuring routes for authentication, when you use `mount_devise_token_auth_for 'User', at: 'auth'` in your routes, you are essentially telling the `devise_token_auth` gem to provide authentication and token management endpoints at the specified route, in this case, '/auth'. The gem automatically generates these endpoints, including sign-up, sign-in, sign-out, and token management.

Here's how it works:

1. When you include `mount_devise_token_auth_for 'User', at: 'auth'` in your routes, the gem generates the following authentication-related routes under '/auth':

   - POST '/auth/sign_in' for signing in.
   - DELETE '/auth/sign_out' for signing out.
   - POST '/auth' for registering a new user (sign-up).
   - PUT '/auth' for updating user information.
   - DELETE '/auth' for destroying the user account.
   - POST '/auth/password' for resetting the password.

2. The `authenticate_user!` method, when added as a `before_action` in your controller, checks if the user is authenticated. It relies on the token-based authentication system provided by
