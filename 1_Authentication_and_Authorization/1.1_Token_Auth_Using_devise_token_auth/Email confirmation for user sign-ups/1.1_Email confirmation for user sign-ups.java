Yes, you can implement email confirmation for user sign-ups in a Rails application that uses `devise_token_auth` for authentication. Here's how to do it:

1. **Install Devise**:

   To enable email confirmation, you'll need to have Devise installed in your Rails application. If you haven't already, add Devise to your Gemfile and run `bundle install`. Follow the Devise installation and setup instructions to configure it properly.

2. **User Model Configuration**:

   Your user model, which uses `devise_token_auth`, should have been generated with Devise. You can add email confirmation to the user model by adding the `:confirmable` module. In your `User` model, make sure it looks something like this:

   ```ruby
   class User < ActiveRecord::Base
     # ...
     devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable, :recoverable, :rememberable, :validatable, :confirmable
     include DeviseTokenAuth::Concerns::User
     # ...
   end
   ```

3. **Migrations**:

   Next, you need to create a migration to add the necessary columns to your users table. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   rails generate migration AddConfirmableToUsers
   ```

   Then, open the generated migration file (found in `db/migrate`) and add the `:confirmation_token`, `:confirmed_at`, and `:confirmation_sent_at` columns to your users table.

   ```ruby
   class AddConfirmableToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0]
     def change
       add_column :users, :confirmation_token, :string
       add_column :users, :confirmed_at, :datetime
       add_column :users, :confirmation_sent_at, :datetime
     end
   end
   ```

   After adding the columns, run the migration:

   ```bash
   rails db:migrate
   ```

4. **Email Configuration**:

   Ensure your application is configured to send emails. You'll need an email provider (e.g., SendGrid, SMTP settings, or other email services) and have email templates set up for sending confirmation emails.

5. **Routes**:

   In your `config/routes.rb` file, you should have already used `devise_for :users` to set up Devise routes. Now, add the following route to enable email confirmation:

   ```ruby
   devise_scope :user do
     get '/users/confirmation' => 'devise/confirmations#show', as: 'user_confirmation'
     post '/users/confirmation' => 'devise/confirmations#create'
   end
   ```

6. **Email Templates**:

   Create email templates for the confirmation email. You can customize these templates in your Rails application by placing them in `app/views/devise/mailer`. There, you can create `confirmation_instructions.html.erb` and `confirmation_instructions.text.erb` templates.

7. **User Registration**:

   When a user signs up, Devise will automatically send a confirmation email to the provided email address. The user needs to click the confirmation link in the email to confirm their email address.

With these steps, your Rails application using `devise_token_auth` and Devise will provide email confirmation for user sign-ups, ensuring that the email is associated with a legitimate user. Users will receive a confirmation email, and their accounts will be confirmed when they click the confirmation link.
