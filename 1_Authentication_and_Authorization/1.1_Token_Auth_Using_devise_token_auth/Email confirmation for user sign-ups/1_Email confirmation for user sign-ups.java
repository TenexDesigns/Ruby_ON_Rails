To implement email confirmation in devise_token_auth for Rails, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the `devise_token_auth` gem: Add `gem 'devise_token_auth'` to your Gemfile and run `bundle install` to install the gem[^7^].

2. Generate the required files: Run the following command to generate the necessary files for devise_token_auth:

   ```shell
   rails generate devise_token_auth:install [UserModel]
   ```

   Replace `[UserModel]` with the name of your user model (e.g., `User`). This command will create the necessary migration files, initializer, and routes[^7^].

3. Run the database migration: After generating the migration files, run the database migration to create the necessary tables:

   ```shell
   rails db:migrate
   ```

4. Configure email settings: Open the `config/initializers/devise.rb` file and configure the email settings. Make sure to set the `config.mailer_sender` option to the email address from which confirmation emails will be sent[^3^].

5. Enable email confirmation: In your user model (e.g., `User`), add the `:confirmable` module to enable email confirmation:

   ```ruby
   class User < ApplicationRecord
     # ...
     devise :confirmable, :omniauthable
     # ...
   end
   ```

6. Customize the confirmation email: You can customize the content of the confirmation email by creating a new file called `confirmation_instructions.html.erb` in the `app/views/devise/mailer` directory. You can use this file to format the email and include any necessary information or instructions[^3^].

7. Update routes: In your `config/routes.rb` file, update the routes for devise_token_auth to include the `:confirmations` controller:

   ```ruby
   Rails.application.routes.draw do
     # ...
     devise_for :users, controllers: {
       confirmations: 'users/confirmations'
     }
     # ...
   end
   ```

8. Create the confirmations controller: Generate a new controller called `users/confirmations_controller.rb` and add the following code to handle the email confirmation:

   ```ruby
   class Users::ConfirmationsController < Devise::ConfirmationsController
     def show
       super do |resource|
         sign_in(resource) if resource.errors.empty?
       end
     end
   end
   ```

   Make sure to update the namespace and path mentioned in the code if necessary[^6^].

9. Allow insecure sign-in after confirmation (optional): By default, Devise does not automatically sign in the user after email confirmation for security reasons. If you want to allow this behavior, you can set `config.allow_insecure_sign_in_after_confirmation = true` in the `config/initializers/devise.rb` file[^6^].

10. Test the email confirmation flow: Start your Rails server and sign up a new user. Check the console logs for the email confirmation link, and click on it to confirm the email. Once confirmed, the user should be able to log in[^3^].

Remember to customize the implementation to fit your specific needs and security requirements.
