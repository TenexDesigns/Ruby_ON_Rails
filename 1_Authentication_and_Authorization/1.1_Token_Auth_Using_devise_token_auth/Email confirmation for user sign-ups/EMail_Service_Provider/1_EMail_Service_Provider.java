To configure email delivery in your Rails application with `devise_token_auth` for email confirmation, you'll need to set up an email service provider and configure your application to use it. Here are the general steps:

1. **Choose an Email Service Provider**:

   You'll need an email service provider to send emails from your application. Some popular options include SendGrid, Mailgun, Amazon SES, and SMTP servers like Gmail or your own mail server. Sign up for an account with your chosen provider if you don't have one.

2. **Set Up Your Environment Variables**:

   To keep your email service credentials secure, store them in environment variables. Create an `.env` file in the root of your Rails application and add your email service credentials. For example, if you're using SendGrid, you might have:

   ```
   SENDGRID_USERNAME=your_sendgrid_username
   SENDGRID_PASSWORD=your_sendgrid_password
   ```

   Install the `dotenv` gem and add it to your `Gemfile`:

   ```ruby
   gem 'dotenv-rails', groups: [:development, :test]
   ```

   Then, run `bundle install` to install the gem. The `dotenv` gem will load your environment variables from the `.env` file automatically in your development and test environments.

3. **Configure Action Mailer**:

   Action Mailer is a component of Rails for sending emails. In your `config/environments/development.rb`, `config/environments/production.rb`, and any other relevant environment files, configure Action Mailer to use your email service provider's SMTP settings. For example, for SendGrid:

   ```ruby
   config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost', port: 3000 }
   config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :smtp
   config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = {
     address: 'smtp.sendgrid.net',
     port: 587,
     user_name: ENV['SENDGRID_USERNAME'],
     password: ENV['SENDGRID_PASSWORD'],
     authentication: 'plain',
     enable_starttls_auto: true
   }
   ```

   You may need to adjust these settings based on your email service provider.

4. **Create Email Templates**:

   In your Rails application, create email templates for the confirmation email and any other emails you plan to send. These templates should be placed in `app/views/devise/mailer`.

   For the confirmation email, create `confirmation_instructions.html.erb` and `confirmation_instructions.text.erb` templates.

   You can customize these templates with the email content and formatting you want to use.

5. **Testing**:

   In development, you can use the `letter_opener` gem to preview emails in your browser instead of actually sending them. Add it to your `Gemfile`:

   ```ruby
   gem 'letter_opener', group: :development
   ```

   Run `bundle install` to install the gem. Configure it in `config/environments/development.rb`:

   ```ruby
   config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :letter_opener
   ```

   Now, when you trigger emails in your development environment, they'll open in your browser for testing.

6. **Deploy and Set Up in Production**:

   In a production environment, ensure you have the proper SMTP settings for your email service provider and that your environment variables are correctly configured. Consult your provider's documentation for specific settings.

7. **Testing in Production**:

   In production, your application should be configured to send real emails. Be sure to thoroughly test email confirmation to ensure it works as expected.

By following these steps, you can configure email delivery in your Rails application with `devise_token_auth` for email confirmation. Users will receive confirmation emails when they sign up, and clicking the confirmation link will confirm their email addresses in the application.
