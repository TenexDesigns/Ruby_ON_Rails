To style emails in ERB, you can use inline styles or include CSS stylesheets in your email templates. Here are two approaches you can take:

1. Inline Styles: You can apply styles directly to HTML elements using the `style` attribute. For example:

   ```erb
   <h1 style="color: red;">Hello, <%= @user.name %>!</h1>
   ```

   In this example, the `style` attribute is used to set the color of the `<h1>` element to red. You can include any CSS properties and values within the `style` attribute to customize the appearance of your email.

   Inline styles are supported by most email clients, but keep in mind that some email clients may strip or ignore certain CSS properties or values. It's a good practice to test your emails across different email clients to ensure consistent rendering.

2. External Stylesheets: If you have complex styling requirements or want to separate your styles from the HTML code, you can include external CSS stylesheets in your email templates. Here's how you can do it:

   a. Create a CSS file: Create a CSS file (e.g., `email_styles.css`) in your Rails application's `app/assets/stylesheets` directory. Add your CSS rules to this file.

   b. Link the CSS file: In your email template, use the `stylesheet_link_tag` helper to include the CSS file. For example:

      ```erb
      <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'email_styles' %>
      ```

      This will generate a `<link>` tag that references the CSS file in the email.

   c. Apply styles: Use CSS classes or IDs in your HTML elements and define the corresponding styles in the external CSS file. For example:

      ```erb
      <h1 class="email-heading">Hello, <%= @user.name %>!</h1>
      ```

      In `email_styles.css`:

      ```css
      .email-heading {
        color: red;
      }
      ```

   External stylesheets provide more flexibility and maintainability, as you can reuse styles across multiple email templates. However, note that some email clients may not fully support external stylesheets or may strip or ignore certain CSS rules.

Remember to test your emails across different email clients to ensure that the styles are applied correctly.

These are the common approaches to styling emails in ERB. Choose the one that best suits your needs and the level of customization required for your email templates.

  To style emails in ERB, you can use CSS. You can inline the CSS in your ERB template, or you can link to a CSS file that is stored on a server.

**Inlining CSS in your ERB template**

To inline CSS in your ERB template, you can use the `style` attribute. For example, the following code will style the `<h1>` tag in red:

```erb
<h1><span style="color: red;">This is a heading</span></h1>
```

**Linking to a CSS file**

To link to a CSS file, you can use the `<link>` tag. For example, the following code will link to a CSS file called `email.css`:

```erb
<link href="https://example.com/email.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
```

**Example of a styled email in ERB**

The following is an example of a styled email in ERB:

```erb
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Email</title>
  <style>
    body {
      font-family: sans-serif;
    }

    h1 {
      color: red;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>This is a heading</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

This email will be displayed with a red heading.

**Tips for styling emails in ERB**

* Keep your CSS simple. Not all email clients support all CSS features.
* Use inline CSS whenever possible. This will help to ensure that your email looks the same in all email clients.
* Avoid using images. Many email clients block images by default.
* Test your email in different email clients to make sure that it looks good.

To style emails in ERB (Embedded Ruby), you can follow these steps:

1. Create an HTML Email Template:
   Start by creating an HTML template for your email using ERB. You can use the `.html.erb` file extension for your email template.

   ```erb
   <!-- email_template.html.erb -->
   <html>
   <head>
     <style>
       /* Define your CSS styles here */
       body {
         font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
         background-color: #f0f0f0;
       }
       .container {
         max-width: 600px;
         margin: 0 auto;
         padding: 20px;
         background-color: #fff;
       }
     </style>
   </head>
   <body>
     <div class="container">
       <h1>Welcome to Our Newsletter!</h1>
       <p>This is a sample email template.</p>
     </div>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

2. Inline CSS:
   To ensure email clients render the styles correctly, its a good practice to inline your CSS styles, as some email clients may not fully support external CSS. You can use tools like Premailer or Mailchimp's CSS Inliner to convert your external CSS to inline CSS.

3. Render the Email Template:
   In your application code (e.g., a Rails controller or a similar framework), you can use ERB to render the email template and pass any dynamic data you want to include in the email. Here's an example of rendering the template in Ruby on Rails:

   ```ruby
   # In your controller action
   def send_email
     @user = User.find(1)
     @message = "Welcome to our newsletter!"
     mail = ERB.new(File.read('path/to/email_template.html.erb')).result(binding)
     # Send the 'mail' variable as an HTML email using your email service or library.
   end
   ```

4. Sending the Email:
   You'll need to use a library or service to send the email. Common options include Action Mailer in Ruby on Rails, SendGrid, or similar services.

Remember that email client support for CSS can be inconsistent, so it's best to keep your email templates relatively simple and thoroughly test them across various email clients to ensure they display as intended. Using inlined CSS and adhering to email coding best practices can help ensure better compatibility across email clients.
