To create email templates for the confirmation email using `devise_token_auth` in your Rails application, you should create both HTML (ERB) and plain text (TXT) templates. These templates should be placed in the `app/views/devise/mailer` directory. Here's how to do it step by step:

1. **Create the Directory**:

   If the `mailer` directory does not exist, create it in the `app/views/devise` directory. Run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p app/views/devise/mailer
   ```

2. **Create HTML (ERB) Template**:

   Create an HTML template for the confirmation email. This template typically contains styled content and HTML tags. You can create a file named `confirmation_instructions.html.erb` within the `app/views/devise/mailer` directory:

   ```erb
   <!-- app/views/devise/mailer/confirmation_instructions.html.erb -->

   <h1>Welcome to Your App</h1>
   <p>Thank you for signing up. Please confirm your email address by clicking the link below:</p>

   <p><%= link_to 'Confirm my account', confirmation_url(@resource, confirmation_token: @token) %></p>

   <p>If you did not sign up for this account, you can safely ignore this email.</p>
   ```

   This HTML template will be used for the confirmation email.

3. **Create Plain Text (TXT) Template**:

   Create a plain text template for the confirmation email. This template is essential for ensuring email accessibility and compatibility across various email clients. Create a file named `confirmation_instructions.text.erb` within the same `app/views/devise/mailer` directory:

   ```erb
   <!-- app/views/devise/mailer/confirmation_instructions.text.erb -->

   Welcome to Your App

   Thank you for signing up. Please confirm your email address by copying and pasting the link below into your browser:

   <%= confirmation_url(@resource, confirmation_token: @token) %>

   If you did not sign up for this account, you can safely ignore this email.
   ```

   This plain text template mirrors the content of the HTML template but without HTML tags.

4. **Customize the Templates**:

   You can customize the templates with your own email content, styling, and branding to match the look and feel of your application. Be sure to include placeholders like `<%= confirmation_url(@resource, confirmation_token: @token) %>` for dynamic data such as the confirmation link.

These templates are used by `devise_token_auth` to send confirmation emails to users when they sign up. The HTML template is used for HTML-formatted email clients, while the plain text template ensures compatibility with text-based email clients.

Once you've created these templates, they will be used automatically when you trigger confirmation emails in your application. You can customize other email templates in a similar way if needed, following the same directory structure and naming conventions.
