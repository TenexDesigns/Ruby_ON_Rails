The provided HTML code appears to be a template for an email. To make it an email template for use with Rails in the context of `devise_token_auth` or any email sending functionality, you need to extract the relevant content and structure it into a format that can be used with Rails email templates. Here's a simplified example of how you can convert the provided HTML into a Rails email template:

1. **Create an Email Template in Rails**:

   In Rails, email templates are typically created using ERB (Embedded Ruby) within `.html.erb` or `.text.erb` files. To create a new email template, you can use the `rails generate mailer` command or create a new `.html.erb` file in your application's views.

2. **Simplify the HTML Structure**:

   You should remove any HTML code that is specific to non-email web pages, such as `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags. 
  Also, remove any CSS styles that won't be needed in emails.

3. **Use Rails Helpers and Variables**:

   In your Rails email template, you can use Rails helpers and variables to generate dynamic content.
  For example, if you want to include the user's name or other dynamic data, you can use ERB tags like `<%= @user.name %>`.

Here's an example of how the provided HTML code could be simplified into a Rails email template:

```erb
<!-- app/views/devise/mailer/confirmation_instructions.html.erb -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Email Confirmation</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div>
    <h1>Welcome to Your App</h1>
    <p>Thank you for signing up. Please confirm your email address by clicking the link below:</p>
    <p><%= link_to 'Confirm my account', confirmation_url(@resource, confirmation_token: @token) %></p>
    <p>If you did not sign up for this account, you can safely ignore this email.</p>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

This simplified template retains the essential content of the email but adapts it for use within a Rails application.
  Make sure to include the necessary Rails variables, helpers, and links for dynamic content.
  This template can be used with Rails' email-sending functionality to send confirmation emails to users who sign up.

You can further customize the email content and styling to match your application's branding and requirements.
