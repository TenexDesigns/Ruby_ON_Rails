When a user signs out using the "DELETE '/auth/sign_out'" endpoint provided by `devise_token_auth`, the process works as follows:

1. **Request to Sign Out**:

   To sign out, the user (or their client application) sends a DELETE request to the '/auth/sign_out' endpoint with their authentication token. The token should be included in the request header as a Bearer token. For example:

   ```http
   DELETE /auth/sign_out
   Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
   ```

2. **Token Expiry**:

   The server processes the request and checks the provided authentication token (YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN) to identify the user's session. Once the server identifies the user session, it marks the token as expired or invalidated. This effectively logs the user out.

3. **Response**:

   After successfully logging the user out, the server sends a response back to the client. The response typically includes a success message, indicating that the user has been signed out. The response may look something like this:

   ```json
   {
     "success": true,
     "data": {
       "message": "Signed out successfully."
     }
   }
   ```

   The response may also include additional information or metadata, depending on your application's configuration or customization.

4. **Token Revocation**:

   In the background, `devise_token_auth` may also perform token revocation to ensure that the token can no longer be used for authentication. This means that even if the token was stolen, it is no longer valid, and the user is effectively logged out.

So, the "DELETE '/auth/sign_out'" endpoint essentially marks the users authentication token as invalid, logs them out, and responds with a success message to confirm the sign-out action. This process helps ensure that the user's session is terminated securely.
