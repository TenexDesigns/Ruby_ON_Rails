When a user signs out using the "DELETE '/auth/sign_out'" endpoint provided by `devise_token_auth`, the process works as follows:

1. **Request to Sign Out**:

   To sign out, the user (or their client application) sends a DELETE request to the '/auth/sign_out' endpoint with their authentication token. The token should be included in the request header as a Bearer token. For example:

   ```http
   DELETE /auth/sign_out
   Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
   ```

2. **Token Expiry**:

   The server processes the request and checks the provided authentication token (YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN) to identify the user's session. Once the server identifies the user session, it marks the token as expired or invalidated. This effectively logs the user out.

3. **Response**:

   After successfully logging the user out, the server sends a response back to the client. The response typically includes a success message, indicating that the user has been signed out. The response may look something like this:

   ```json
   {
     "success": true,
     "data": {
       "message": "Signed out successfully."
     }
   }
   ```

   The response may also include additional information or metadata, depending on your application's configuration or customization.

4. **Token Revocation**:

   In the background, `devise_token_auth` may also perform token revocation to ensure that the token can no longer be used for authentication. This means that even if the token was stolen, it is no longer valid, and the user is effectively logged out.

So, the "DELETE '/auth/sign_out'" endpoint essentially marks the users authentication token as invalid, logs them out, and responds with a success message to confirm the sign-out action. This process helps ensure that the user's session is terminated securely.

   When a user signs out of a devise_token_auth application, the following steps are taken:

1. The user's authentication token is blacklisted. This prevents the user from using their token to authenticate to the application in the future.
2. The user's session is deleted. This prevents the user from using their session to access protected resources in the application.
3. The user is redirected to the root path of the application.

To sign out, a user must send a DELETE request to the `/auth/sign_out` endpoint. The request body must include the user's authentication token.

The `/auth/sign_out` endpoint will return a JSON response with the following status codes:

* **204 No Content:** The user was successfully signed out.
* **401 Unauthorized:** The user's authentication token is invalid or has been blacklisted.

Here is an example of a DELETE request to the `/auth/sign_out` endpoint:

```
DELETE /auth/sign_out
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
```

Here is an example of a JSON response from the `/auth/sign_out` endpoint:

```json
{
  "status": "success"
}
```

Once a user has signed out, they will no longer be able to access protected resources in the application until they sign in again.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind about signing out with devise_token_auth:

* If a user has multiple authentication tokens, all of their tokens will be blacklisted when they sign out.
* If a user has a session open on multiple devices, all of their sessions will be deleted when they sign out.
* If a user is signed in to multiple applications that use devise_token_auth, signing out of one application will not sign them out of the other applications.

I hope this helps!
