Implementing access authorization in a Ruby on Rails application often involves using gems like Bali or CanCanCan to define and manage access rules. Below, I'll provide a step-by-step guide on how to implement access authorization using Bali, along with code samples:

1. **Add Bali Gem**:

   First, add the Bali gem to your Rails application by including it in your Gemfile and running `bundle install`. Here's how to add the gem to your Gemfile:

   ```ruby
   gem 'bali'
   ```

2. **Define Roles**:

   In Bali, you start by defining roles that represent different user permissions. These roles can be defined in an initializer file, such as `config/initializers/bali.rb`. For example:

   ```ruby
   # config/initializers/bali.rb
   Bali.configure do |config|
     config.roles = {
       admin: 'User is an admin',
       moderator: 'User is a moderator',
       user: 'Regular user',
     }
   end
   ```

3. **Authorize Access**:

   You can use Bali's DSL to define access rules in your controllers or models. Let's say you want to ensure that only the user's followers can access their timeline. You can do this in a controller like this:

   ```ruby
   # app/controllers/timeline_controller.rb
   class TimelineController < ApplicationController
     authorize :show, by: :user do
       allowed { |user| user.followers.include?(current_user) }
       denied { |user| !user.followers.include?(current_user) }
     end

     def show
       # Your timeline logic here
     end
   end
   ```

   In this example, the `authorize` method is used to define the access rule for the `show` action of the `TimelineController`. The `allowed` block specifies who is allowed to access the action, and the `denied` block specifies who is denied access.

4. **Checking Access**:

   You can use Bali's helper methods to check whether a user has permission to perform a specific action. For example:

   ```ruby
   # app/controllers/timeline_controller.rb
   class TimelineController < ApplicationController
     def show
       if authorized?(:show, @user)
         # Render the timeline
       else
         # Redirect or show an error message
       end
     end
   end
   ```

   In this code, the `authorized?` method checks if the current user is authorized to access the timeline of `@user`.

5. **User Privacy Settings**:

   To allow users to set their privacy levels, you can create a settings page in your Rails application where users can select their desired privacy settings. You may use a simple form with options for privacy settings and save the user's choice in the database.

   For example, if a user sets their profile to "private," you can use Bali to implement the corresponding access rules.

6. **Testing and Fine-Tuning**:

   It's crucial to thoroughly test your access authorization rules to ensure that they work as expected. Test various scenarios, including edge cases, to make sure that users can only access what they are authorized to see.

That's a basic guide to implementing access authorization with Bali in your Rails application. Bali provides a powerful DSL for defining access rules and can be a valuable tool for managing permissions in your application. Be sure to consult the Bali documentation for more advanced use cases and fine-tuning of access control rules.
