The code samples you provided are related to implementing a follow/unfollow system and managing follow requests in a Ruby on Rails application. Here's a breakdown of the implementation steps along with code samples:

1. **Create `visited_user` Helper Function**:

   Define a helper function called `visited_user` in the `ApplicationHelper` to fetch the user resource based on the `username` parameter. This function is used to identify the user whose profile is being visited.

   ```ruby
   # app/helpers/application_helper.rb
   def visited_user
     @visited_user ||= begin
       username = params.fetch(:username)
       User.find_by_username!(username)
     end
   end
   ```

2. **Create `BondsController`**:

   Generate a new controller called `BondsController` using the Rails generator. This controller will handle actions related to following and unfollowing users.

   ```bash
   $ rails g controller Bonds --no-helper --no-assets --no-test-framework
   ```

   Add the code for the `BondsController` as shown in Listing 9-36. This code includes the `follow` action for following users.

   ```ruby
   # app/controllers/bonds_controller.rb
   class BondsController < ApplicationController
     delegate :visited_user, to: :helpers

     def follow
       # Authorization check
       unless can? :follow, visited_user
         return redirect_to timeline_path(visited_user)
       end

       bond = Bond::Follower.call(current_user, visited_user)

       if bond.requesting?
         flash[:notice] = "A follow request has been sent to @#{visited_user.username} and is pending their approval."
       end

       redirect_to timeline_path(visited_user)
     end
   end
   ```

3. **Define `Bond::Follower` Service**:

   Create a service class called `Bond::Follower` to handle the logic of creating a follow relationship between users. This service class is responsible for creating the bond and specifying whether it's a direct follow or a follow request.

   ```ruby
   # app/services/bond/follower.rb
   class Bond::Follower < ApplicationService
     attr_reader :requester, :target_user

     def initialize(requester, target_user)
       @requester = requester
       @target_user = target_user
     end

     def call
       bond = requester.bonds.build(friend: target_user, state: bond_state)
       bond.save!
       bond
     end

     private

     def bond_state
       case target_user.is_public?
       when true then Bond::FOLLOWING
       when false then Bond::REQUESTING
       end
     end
   end
   ```

4. **Update View and Routes**:

   Update the views, routes, and buttons in the frontend to allow users to follow and unfollow others. These changes involve updating the `bonds/_bonding_buttons.html.erb` partial, routes in `routes.rb`, and view templates for followers and following lists.

5. **Create Unfollow Functionality**:

   Similar to the follow functionality, create an `unfollow` action in the `BondsController` to allow users to unfollow others. Add a new route for the `unfollow` action in `routes.rb`.

6. **Define `Bond::Unfollower` Service**:

   Create a service class called `Bond::Unfollower` to handle the logic of unfollowing a user. This service class is responsible for finding and destroying the existing bond between users.

7. **Update Frontend**:

   Update the frontend to display unfollow buttons and allow users to unfollow those they have followed.

8. **Accept and Reject Requests**:

   To allow users to accept or reject follow requests, create pages for followers and following lists. In these lists, users can manage their followers and pending follow requests.

   Update routes in `routes.rb` to include `followers` and `following` actions.

   Create view templates for displaying followers and following lists. Use partials and styles to render user profiles and buttons appropriately.

This implementation allows users to follow and unfollow each other, as well as manage follow requests. It provides a basic foundation for implementing social network features in a Ruby on Rails application.
