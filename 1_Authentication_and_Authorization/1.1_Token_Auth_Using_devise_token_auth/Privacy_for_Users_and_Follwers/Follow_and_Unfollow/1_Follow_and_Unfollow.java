Sure, here is a breakdown of the code samples you provided:

**Adding the "follow" and "unfollow" routes**

```
resources :bonds, param: :username do
  member do
    post :follow
    post :unfollow
  end
end
```

This code adds two new routes to the `BondsController`: `follow` and `unfollow`. These routes will be used to follow and unfollow other users, respectively.

**Implementing the "follow" and "unfollow" actions**

```ruby
def follow
  unless can? :follow, visited_user
    return redirect_to timeline_path(visited_user)
  end

  bond = Bond::Follower.call(
    current_user,
    visited_user,
  )

  if bond.requesting?
    flash[:notice] = "A follow request has been sent to " +
                      "@#{visited_user.username} and is pending their approval."
  end

  redirect_to timeline_path(visited_user)
end

def unfollow
  unless can? :unfollow, visited_user
    return redirect_to timeline_path(visited_user)
  end

  bond = Bond::Unfollower.call(
    current_user,
    visited_user,
  )

  redirect_to timeline_path(visited_user)
end
```

These actions implement the logic for following and unfollowing other users. The `follow` action checks to make sure that the current user is allowed to follow the visited user. If they are, it creates a new `Bond` record. If the visited user's account is private, the `Bond` record will be in the `requesting` state. Otherwise, the `Bond` record will be in the `following` state.

The `unfollow` action checks to make sure that the current user is allowed to unfollow the visited user. If they are, it deletes the `Bond` record between the two users.

**Creating the Bond::Follower and Bond::Unfollower services**

```ruby
class Bond::Follower < ApplicationService
  attr_reader :requester, :target_user
  private :requester, :target_user

  def initialize(requester, target_user)
    @requester = requester
    @target_user = target_user
  end

  def call
    bond = requester.bonds.build(
      friend: target_user,
      state: bond_state
    )

    bond.save!

    bond
  end

  private

  def bond_state
    case target_user.is_public?
    when true then Bond::FOLLOWING
    when false then Bond::REQUESTING
    end
  end
end

class Bond::Unfollower < ApplicationService
  attr_reader :requester, :target_user
  private :requester, :target_user

  def initialize(requester, target_user)
    @requester = requester
    @target_user = target_user
  end

  def call
    bond = requester.bonds.where(friend: target_user).first
    return unless bond

    bond.destroy!
  end
end
```

These services provide a convenient way to encapsulate the logic for following and unfollowing other users. They can be used from anywhere in the application, such as the `BondsController` or a view.

**Creating the followers and following pages**

```
# routes.rb
resources :bonds, param: :username do
  member do
    post :follow
    post :unfollow
    get :followers
    get :following
  end
end

# views/bonds/followers.html.erb
<%= render "timelines/profile_header", user: visited_user %>
<%= render "bonds/users_list", users: @bonded_users %>

# views/bonds/following.html.erb
<%= render "timelines/profile_header", user: visited_user %>
<%= render "bonds/users_list", users: @bonded_users do |each_user| %>
  <%= render "bonds/bonding_buttons", user: each_user %>
<% end %>
```

These files create the followers and following pages. The followers page displays a list of users who follow the current user. The following page displays a list of users who the current user follows.

The `users_list` partial is used to render the list of users on both pages. The `bonding_buttons` partial is used to render the follow and unfollow buttons on the following page.

I hope this breakdown is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
