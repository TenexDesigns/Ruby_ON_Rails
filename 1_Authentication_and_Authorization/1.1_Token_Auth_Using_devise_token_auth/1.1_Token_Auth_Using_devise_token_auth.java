As of my knowledge cutoff date in January 2022, "devise_token_auth" was a popular gem for token-based authentication in Ruby on Rails applications, but it may not be officially supported in Rails 7 because the Rails ecosystem evolves over time, and new versions of Rails can introduce changes that may affect gem compatibility. To check if "devise_token_auth" is compatible with Rails 7, you should review the gem's documentation and GitHub repository for the latest updates and compatibility information.

Assuming that "devise_token_auth" is compatible with Rails 7 or an alternative solution is available, here's how you can implement user authentication with sign-in, sign-up, and sign-out functionality in a Rails application:

**Step 1: Add "devise_token_auth" to Your Gemfile**

Assuming that "devise_token_auth" is compatible with Rails 7, add it to your Rails application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'devise_token_auth'
```

Then, run `bundle install` to install the gem.

**Step 2: Configure Devise and Devise Token Auth**

Next, run the generators provided by "devise_token_auth" to set up the necessary configurations:

```bash
rails generate devise_token_auth:install User auth
```

This command will generate the required migrations, routes, and configurations for authentication.

**Step 3: Run Migrations**

Run the migrations to create the necessary database tables:

```bash
rails db:migrate
```

**Step 4: Define User Model and Associations**

In your user model (usually located at `app/models/user.rb`), ensure that it includes the required modules:

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  include DeviseTokenAuth::Concerns::User
  # ... any other associations or validations ...
end
```

**Step 5: Configure Routes**

Ensure that your routes are correctly configured in `config/routes.rb`. Here's an example of the routes for user authentication:

```ruby
mount_devise_token_auth_for 'User', at: 'auth'
```

This configuration mounts the authentication routes under the `/auth` path.

**Step 6: Create Controllers for Additional Actions (Optional)**

You can create custom controllers for additional actions like sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out if needed. For example, you might want to create a `RegistrationsController` for user registration and custom actions.

**Step 7: Set Up the Views (Optional)**

If you want to provide custom views for registration or sign-in, you can generate the views using:

```bash
rails generate devise_token_auth:install:views
```

You can then customize the generated views in the `app/views/devise` directory.

**Step 8: Implement Authentication in Your Application**

You can use the API endpoints provided by "devise_token_auth" to allow users to sign up, sign in, and sign out. Here are some common API endpoints:

- Sign-up: POST to `/auth` with the user's email, password, and other required information.
- Sign-in: POST to `/auth/sign_in` with the user's email and password to obtain a token.
- Sign-out: DELETE to `/auth/sign_out` with the user's token to log the user out.

Be sure to consult the "devise_token_auth" documentation for more details on how to make API requests and handle responses.

**Step 9: Secure Your API**

Implement proper security measures, such as using HTTPS, handling token expiration, and handling token refresh, to enhance the security of your API.

Remember that the steps and gem version mentioned here are based on information available as of January 2022. Always refer to the latest documentation and gem versions for any updates or changes specific to your Rails 7 application.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
  When you want to add additional information to the sign-up or user registration process, such as the user's name or other required information, you can achieve this by customizing the user registration process in your Rails application. To do this, you can follow these steps:

1. **Customize the User Model:**
   Modify your `User` model to include the necessary fields. For example, if you want to include a `name` field, your `user.rb` model might look like this:

   ```ruby
   class User < ActiveRecord::Base
     include DeviseTokenAuth::Concerns::User

     # Additional fields
     validates :name, presence: true
     # Add any other validations or associations you need
   end
   ```

2. **Update Strong Parameters:**
   Ensure that the additional fields are permitted in the strong parameters in your `RegistrationsController`. If you don't have a custom registrations controller, you can create one to handle the sign-up process. Here's an example:

   ```ruby
   # app/controllers/v1/registrations_controller.rb (if using namespacing)

   module V1
     class RegistrationsController < DeviseTokenAuth::RegistrationsController
       private

       def sign_up_params
         params.permit(:name, :email, :password, :password_confirmation)
       end

       # ...
     end
   end
   ```

   In this example, we've added the `:name` parameter to the `sign_up_params` method to permit the `name` field during sign-up. You can customize this method further to permit additional fields as needed.

3. **Update the Routes:**
   To use the customized registrations controller, update your routes to point to it:

   ```ruby
   # config/routes.rb

   namespace :v1 do
     mount_devise_token_auth_for 'User', at: 'auth', controllers: {
       registrations: 'v1/registrations' # Adjust the namespace and controller name as needed
     }
   end
   ```

   Here, we've specified the `registrations` controller as `'v1/registrations'`. Make sure the controller namespace and name match your application's naming conventions.

With these changes, your sign-up process allows users to provide additional information such as a name, alongside the email and password. You can further customize the registration process to suit your application's specific requirements.

If you're using namespacing and versioning, as shown in your code, you should update the `mount_devise_token_auth_for` line as demonstrated above. The `controllers` option allows you to specify the controller to handle the registration process within your specified namespace.

Please ensure that the versioning, namespace, and controller names align with your application's naming conventions and directory structure.
