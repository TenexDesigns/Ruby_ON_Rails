In Ruby on Rails, the Devise gem is a popular authentication solution that provides a set of ready-to-use modules for authentication. These modules enable you to add various authentication features to your application without having to write the code from scratch. Here's an overview of the ten modules provided by Devise:

1. **confirmable**: This module requires users to confirm their email address by visiting a generated link before they can sign in for the first time. It adds functionality for sending confirmation emails and handling the confirmation process.

2. **database_authenticatable**: This module handles the authentication process by hashing the user's password before saving it into the database. It provides methods for validating the user's credentials during sign-in.

3. **lockable**: The lockable module adds a mechanism to block a user's account after a certain number of failed login attempts. It helps prevent brute-force attacks by temporarily locking the account.

4. **omniauthable**: This module adds support for authentication through third-party providers using OmniAuth. It allows users to sign in using their accounts from services like Google, Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, etc.

5. **recoverable**: The recoverable module enables users to reset their password if they have forgotten it. It provides functionality for sending password reset instructions and handling the password recovery process.

6. **registerable**: This module allows users to sign up and create an account. It provides functionality for user registration, including validation of email and password fields.

7. **rememberable**: The rememberable module allows sessions to remain valid for a specified period, typically using a "remember me" functionality. It provides methods for generating and managing remember tokens.

8. **trackable**: This module adds basic tracking functionality to the user model. It tracks information such as the user's IP address, the last sign-in time, the number of sign-ins, and the last sign-in time.

9. **timeoutable**: The timeoutable module allows you to automatically log out a user after a certain period of inactivity. It helps improve security by ensuring that inactive sessions are terminated.

10. **validatable**: This module performs validations on the email and password fields. It provides methods for validating the format and uniqueness of the email, as well as the presence and length of the password.

To use these modules in your Rails application with Devise and Devise Token Auth, you need to include them in your user model. Here's an example of how you can include the modules in your `User` model:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  # Include default devise modules
  devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable,
         :recoverable, :rememberable, :trackable, :validatable,
         :confirmable, :lockable, :omniauthable, :timeoutable
         
  # Include devise_token_auth modules
  include DeviseTokenAuth::Concerns::User
end
```

By including the desired modules in your user model, you can enable the corresponding authentication features in your Rails application. Each module provides additional configuration options and methods that you can customize to fit your specific requirements.
