The Devise modules you mentioned enable us to do the following in Rails:

* **confirmable:** Force users to confirm their email address before they can sign in for the first time. This helps to reduce spam and ensure that users have valid email addresses.
* **database_authenticatable:** This module provides basic user authentication using email and password. It hashes the password before saving it in the database, which makes it more secure.
* **lockable:** This module locks a user's account after a certain number of failed login attempts. This helps to protect against brute-force attacks.
* **omniauthable:** This module allows users to sign in using third-party OAuth providers such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter. This makes it easier for users to sign up and log in to your application.
* **recoverable:** This module allows users to reset their password if they have forgotten it. This helps to prevent users from being locked out of their accounts.
* **registerable:** This module allows users to sign up for your application. It validates the user's email address and password before creating the account.
* **rememberable:** This module allows users to stay logged in for a certain period of time (by default two weeks). This makes it more convenient for users who use your application frequently.
* **trackable:** This module tracks basic information about user activity, such as their IP address, last sign-in time, and number of sign-ins. This information can be used for security purposes and to improve the user experience.
* **timeoutable:** This module logs out a user after a certain period of inactivity. This helps to prevent unauthorized access to accounts.
* **validatable:** This module performs validations on the user's email address and password. This helps to ensure that the user's data is valid and secure.

Here are some code samples showing how to use these modules in Rails:

```ruby
# Enable the confirmable module
class User < ApplicationRecord
  devise :confirmable
end

# Send a confirmation email to the user
user = User.new(email: 'user@example.com')
user.send_confirmation_instructions

# Confirm the user's email address
user.confirm!

# Enable the omniauthable module
class User < ApplicationRecord
  devise :omniauthable
end

# Allow users to sign in with Google
OmniAuth.config.providers[:google] = {
  :client_id => 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
  :client_secret => 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET'
}

# Enable the recoverable module
class User < ApplicationRecord
  devise :recoverable
end

# Reset the user's password
user = User.find_by(email: 'user@example.com')
user.send_reset_password_instructions

# Enable the registerable module
class User < ApplicationRecord
  devise :registerable
end

# Create a new user account
user = User.new(email: 'user@example.com', password: 'password')
user.save

# Enable the rememberable module
class User < ApplicationRecord
  devise :rememberable
end

# Keep the user logged in for two weeks
user = User.find_by(email: 'user@example.com')
user.remember_me = true
user.save

# Enable the trackable module
class User < ApplicationRecord
  devise :trackable
end

# Get the user's last sign-in time
user = User.find_by(email: 'user@example.com')
last_sign_in_time = user.last_sign_in_at

# Enable the timeoutable module
class User < ApplicationRecord
  devise :timeoutable
end

# Log the user out after 30 minutes of inactivity
user = User.find_by(email: 'user@example.com')
user.timeout_in = 30.minutes
user.save

# Enable the validatable module
class User < ApplicationRecord
  devise :validatable
end

# Validate the user's email address
user = User.new(email: 'user@example.com', password: 'password')
user.valid?
```

These are just a few examples of how to use the Devise modules. For more information, please see the Devise documentation.
