To receive additional data during user registration, you need to make changes to the User model, modify its migrations, and permit the new fields in the strong parameters. Here's a step-by-step guide:

**Step 1: Modify the User Model**

1. **Initial User Model:**
   The initial User model typically includes fields like `email` and `password`, as these are the basic requirements for user authentication. In a basic setup, your User model might look like this:

   ```ruby
   class User < ActiveRecord::Base
     include DeviseTokenAuth::Concerns::User
   end
   ```

2. **Add Additional Fields:**
   To receive additional data, such as the user's name, you need to modify the User model to include these fields. For example, if you want to add a `name` field, update the User model as follows:

   ```ruby
   class User < ActiveRecord::Base
     include DeviseTokenAuth::Concerns::User

     # Additional fields
     validates :name, presence: true
   end
   ```

   This code adds a `name` field to the User model and includes a validation to ensure that a name is provided during user registration.

**Step 2: Create Migrations for Additional Fields**

1. **Generate a Migration:**
   Create a migration to add the new fields to the users table. Run the following command, replacing `field_name` with the actual field name (e.g., `name`):

   ```bash
   rails generate migration AddFieldNameToUsers field_name:string
   ```

   This command generates a migration file that includes the new field as a string. The migration file will be located in the `db/migrate` directory.

2. **Update the Migration:**
   Open the generated migration file and update it to add the new field. For example, if you're adding a `name` field, your migration might look like this:

   ```ruby
   class AddNameToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.1]
     def change
       add_column :users, :name, :string
     end
   end
   ```

3. **Run the Migration:**
   Execute the migration to apply the changes to the database:

   ```bash
   rails db:migrate
   ```

   This command adds the new field to the users table in the database.

**Step 3: Update Strong Parameters**

1. **Define Strong Parameters:**
   In the DeviseTokenAuth registration controller (e.g., `RegistrationsController`), make sure to permit the new field in the strong parameters. This allows the new field to be accepted during user registration. For example, if you've added a `name` field, your controller might look like this:

   ```ruby
   module V1
     class RegistrationsController < DeviseTokenAuth::RegistrationsController
       private

       def sign_up_params
         params.permit(:name, :email, :password, :password_confirmation)
       end

       # ...
     end
   end
   ```

   Here, the `:name` field is permitted in the `sign_up_params` method.

2. **Update the Routes:**
   As mentioned in a previous response, update your routes to point to the customized registrations controller that includes the new field.

With these changes, your User model is modified to accept the additional data, and users can provide the `name` field during registration. You've also added the new field to the database and permitted it in the strong parameters for registration.
