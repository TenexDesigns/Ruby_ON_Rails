To implement token-based authentication in Rails, you can use the `devise-jwt` gem along with the `devise` gem. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to set it up:

1. Install the necessary gems by adding them to your Gemfile and running `bundle install`:

```ruby
gem 'devise'
gem 'devise-jwt'
```

2. Generate the User model and configure Devise:

```bash
rails generate devise:install
rails generate devise User
```

This will generate the necessary files for Devise and the User model.

3. Configure Devise to use JWT as the authentication strategy. In `config/initializers/devise.rb`, add the following line:

```ruby
config.jwt do |jwt|
  jwt.secret = ENV['DEVISE_JWT_SECRET_KEY']
end
```

Make sure to set the `DEVISE_JWT_SECRET_KEY` environment variable to a secure value.

4. Update the User model to include the `:jwt_authenticatable` module:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable,
         :jwt_authenticatable, jwt_revocation_strategy: Devise::JWT::RevocationStrategies::Null
end
```

This will enable JWT authentication for the User model.

5. Generate a migration to add the necessary columns to the users table:

```bash
rails generate migration AddJwtToUsers jti:string:index
```

This will add a `jti` column to the users table to store the JWT token identifier.

6. Run the migration:

```bash
rails db:migrate
```

7. Update the routes to include the necessary endpoints for authentication:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  devise_for :users, controllers: {
    sessions: 'users/sessions',
    registrations: 'users/registrations'
  }
end
```

This will generate the routes for sign in, sign up, and sign out.

8. Create the necessary controllers for sessions and registrations:

```ruby
class Users::SessionsController < Devise::SessionsController
  respond_to :json
end

class Users::RegistrationsController < Devise::RegistrationsController
  respond_to :json
end
```

9. Update the ApplicationController to include the necessary authentication logic:

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::API
  before_action :authenticate_user!
end
```

This will require authentication for all endpoints.

10. Set the token lifespan in `config/initializers/devise.rb`:

```ruby
config.jwt do |jwt|
  jwt.expiration_time = 1.day.to_i
end
```

This will set the token lifespan to 1 day.

That's it! You have now implemented token-based authentication using `devise-jwt` in Rails. Here's a summary of the functionality:

- Sign in: Send a POST request to `/users/sign_in` with the user's email and password. The response will include the JWT token.
- Sign up: Send a POST request to `/users` with the user's email, username, and password. The response will include the JWT token.
- Sign out: Send a DELETE request to `/users/sign_out` with the user's JWT token in the Authorization header.

The protected endpoints can be defined in your controllers by using the `before_action :authenticate_user!` filter.

Please note that this is a basic implementation and you may need to customize it further based on your specific requirements.
