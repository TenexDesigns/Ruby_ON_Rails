I can help you with implementing token-based authentication in Rails using the `devise-jwt` gem. Here's a step-by-step guide with code samples to set up authentication, including sign-in, sign-up, and token-based authentication. 

**Step 1: Create a new Rails application**

Assuming you have Rails and Bundler installed, create a new Rails application if you haven't already:

```bash
rails new YourAppName
cd YourAppName
```

**Step 2: Add necessary gems to your Gemfile**

In your `Gemfile`, add the following gems:

```ruby
gem 'devise'
gem 'devise-jwt'
```

Then run `bundle install` to install these gems.

**Step 3: Set up Devise**

Run the following command to set up Devise:

```bash
rails generate devise:install
```

This will generate configuration files. Follow the instructions in the terminal for any additional setup required, such as setting up your default URL options.

**Step 4: Create a User model**

Generate a User model using Devise:

```bash
rails generate devise User
```

Migrate the database to create the Users table:

```bash
rails db:migrate
```

**Step 5: Configure Devise for JWT**

Open the `config/initializers/devise.rb` file and add the following configuration for `devise-jwt`:

```ruby
config.jwt do |jwt|
  jwt.secret = ENV['DEVISE_JWT_SECRET_KEY']
  jwt.dispatch_requests = [['POST', %r{^/auth/login$}]]
  jwt.revocation_requests = [['DELETE', %r{^/auth/logout$}]]
  jwt.expiration_time = 1.day.to_i
end
```

This configures `devise-jwt` to use an environment variable `DEVISE_JWT_SECRET_KEY` for JWT encryption and sets the expiration time for tokens to 1 day.

**Step 6: Configure routes**

In your `config/routes.rb` file, set up routes for user registration and authentication:

```ruby
devise_for :users, controllers: {
  sessions: 'users/sessions',
  registrations: 'users/registrations'
}
```

**Step 7: Create a Sessions controller**

Generate a Sessions controller for handling sign-in and sign-out:

```bash
rails generate controller Users::Sessions
```

In `app/controllers/users/sessions_controller.rb`, customize the controller as follows:

```ruby
class Users::SessionsController < Devise::SessionsController
  include Devise::Controllers::Helpers
  protect_from_forgery with: :null_session
end
```

**Step 8: Create a Registrations controller**

Generate a Registrations controller for user registration:

```bash
rails generate controller Users::Registrations
```

In `app/controllers/users/registrations_controller.rb`, customize the controller as follows:

```ruby
class Users::RegistrationsController < Devise::RegistrationsController
  include Devise::Controllers::Helpers
  protect_from_forgery with: :null_session
end
```

**Step 9: Set up user model**

In your `User` model (`app/models/user.rb`), make sure it includes `:jwt_authenticatable`:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  # ...
  devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable, :jwt_authenticatable, jwt_revocation_strategy: JWTBlacklist
end
```

**Step 10: Set up your JWT secret key**

In your environment-specific configuration (e.g., `config/environments/development.rb`), set the `DEVISE_JWT_SECRET_KEY`:

```ruby
config.devise_jwt.secret_key = Rails.application.credentials.devise_jwt[:secret_key]
```

**Step 11: Controller authorization**

To protect specific endpoints, add the following code to your controllers:

```ruby
before_action :authenticate_user!, except: :public_action
```

This code will ensure that only authenticated users can access the protected actions.

**Step 12: Start your Rails server**

You can now start your Rails server and test the sign-up and sign-in functionality. Tokens will be generated and used for authentication.

That's a basic setup for token-based authentication with `devise-jwt` in Rails. You can customize and expand this as needed for your application.
