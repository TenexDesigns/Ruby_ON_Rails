To utilize JRuby's multi-threading capabilities and handle concurrent requests in a Rails GraphQL API, you can follow these code samples and techniques:

**1. Configure Your Rails Application for JRuby:**

Ensure that you're using JRuby as your Ruby interpreter. You can specify the Ruby version in your `.ruby-version` file or by configuring your Ruby version manager (e.g., RVM or RBEnv) to use JRuby. Make sure your Gemfile includes JRuby-compatible gems.

**2. Thread-Safe GraphQL Execution:**

By default, GraphQL queries in Ruby are executed serially, meaning they don't take full advantage of JRuby's multi-threading capabilities. To execute queries concurrently, you can use JRuby's built-in `concurrent-ruby` gem, specifically the `Concurrent::Future` class. Here's an example of how to use it:

```ruby
# app/graphql/graphql_controller.rb
class GraphqlController < ApplicationController
  def execute
    query = params[:query]
    variables = ensure_hash(params[:variables])
    operation_name = params[:operationName]
    
    context = {
      # Your context options here
    }
    
    future = Concurrent::Future.execute do
      MySchema.execute(
        query,
        variables: variables,
        context: context,
        operation_name: operation_name
      )
    end

    result = future.value
    render json: result
  end
end
```

In this example, the GraphQL query execution is wrapped in a `Concurrent::Future`, allowing it to be executed concurrently by JRuby. This approach improves the handling of concurrent requests.

**3. Configuration and Optimization:**

To further optimize your Rails GraphQL API for JRuby, you can fine-tune the JRuby runtime settings and configurations. You can configure thread pool sizes, garbage collection settings, and other parameters based on your application's specific needs.

**4. Load Testing and Performance Tuning:**

Conduct load testing to evaluate the performance of your Rails GraphQL API with JRuby under various concurrent request scenarios. Adjust your application's configuration and thread pool sizes to achieve the desired level of concurrency and scalability.

By incorporating these techniques and code samples, you can leverage JRuby's multi-threading capabilities to enhance the concurrency and performance of your Rails GraphQL API. JRuby's seamless integration with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) makes it a valuable choice for handling multiple requests efficiently.
