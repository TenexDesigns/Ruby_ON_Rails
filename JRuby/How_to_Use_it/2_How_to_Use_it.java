JRuby is a high performance, stable, fully threaded Java implementation of the Ruby programming language. It provides the ability to embed the interpreter into any Java application and to run Ruby scripts from Java code. JRuby is tightly integrated with Java to allow the embedding of the interpreter into any Java application with full two-way access between the Java and the Ruby code [Source 11](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19776-01/820-4926/chapterone/index.html).

In the context of Rails, JRuby enables concurrent, high-performance execution of Rails applications. You can run your Rails application on JRuby just like you would with the standard Ruby interpreter, MRI. JRuby is compatible with Rails 6 and 7, and allows you to leverage the power of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and its mature ecosystem [Source 1](https://wearebrain.com/blog/how-to-run-a-rails-application-on-jruby-or-how-a-rails-application-is-run-inside-war/).

Java comes into play in JRuby in several ways:

1. JRuby runs on the JVM, which means it can utilize the JVM's advanced features such as Just-In-Time compilation, garbage collection, and threading model.
2. JRuby can seamlessly integrate with Java libraries and frameworks. You can call Java code from Ruby and vice versa.
3. JRuby leverages the JVM's robustness and performance optimizations, which can lead to significant performance improvements for Ruby applications.

Scaling a Rails application with JRuby can be achieved through:

1. Multithreading: JRuby supports native threads, which means you can run multiple threads in a single JRuby process. This allows for efficient utilization of multi-core processors and can significantly improve the throughput of your Rails application.
2. JVM optimizations: The JVM has advanced performance optimizations such as Just-In-Time compilation and garbage collection, which can help improve the performance and scalability of your Rails application.
3. Java Integration: You can leverage the mature Java ecosystem, which includes a wide range of libraries and frameworks for tasks such as caching, messaging, and database access.

Migrating to JRuby involves changing your Ruby version to JRuby, resolving any compatibility issues with gems or libraries, and potentially rewriting some parts of your code to take advantage of JRuby's features. The `jruby-lint` gem can be used to check your code for compatibility issues with JRuby [Source 4](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/moving-an-existing-rails-app-to-run-on-jruby).

JRuby's support for true parallelism can allow a Rails application to handle thousands of requests per minute, but the actual throughput will depend on many factors, including the complexity of your application, the performance of your database, and the capacity of your server.

Here's a simple example of how to use JRuby with Rails:

1. First, install JRuby. You can use a version manager like RVM or rbenv.
   
   ```bash
   rvm install jruby
   ```

2. Set JRuby as the current Ruby version:

   ```bash
   rvm use jruby
   ```

3. Create a new Rails application:

   ```bash
   rails new myapp
   ```

4. Run the Rails server:

   ```bash
   rails server
   ```

In this example, the Rails application will run on JRuby and can take advantage of JRuby's features such as multithreading and Java integration.
