The syntax you provided, `Rails.application.config.filter_parameters`, is an example of chain accessing or chain calling of methods and objects in Ruby and Rails. It is not limited to Rails; you can use this syntax to access nested methods, objects, and properties in Ruby.

In this specific example:

- `Rails` is a module or namespace.
- `application` is a method or object within the `Rails` module.
- `config` is a method or object within the result of `application`.
- `filter_parameters` is a method or property within the result of `config`.

The chain of calls allows you to access properties or methods in a structured and organized way. Each part of the chain returns an object or value, and you continue to call methods or access properties on that returned object.

Here's a simplified example to illustrate the concept:

```ruby
class School
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def principal
    Principal.new("John")
  end
end

class Principal
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def greet
    "Hello, I'm #{@name}, the principal of the school."
  end
end

school = School.new("XYZ School")
principal = school.principal
greeting = principal.greet

puts greeting
```

In this example, `school.principal.greet` is similar to `Rails.application.config.filter_parameters`. It's a chain of method calls that starts with an instance of `School`, retrieves a `Principal` object, and then calls the `greet` method on the `Principal` object.

So, to summarize, the continuous dot syntax allows you to access nested methods, objects, or properties within classes or modules, and it's a common way to navigate through structured data or configurations.
