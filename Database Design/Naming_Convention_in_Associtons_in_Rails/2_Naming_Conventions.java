In Rails, the naming convention for associations is as follows:

1. For a `has_many` association, you should use the plural form of the model name. For example, if a User has many Posts, you would write `has_many :posts`.

2. For a `belongs_to` association, you should use the singular form of the model name. For example, if a Post belongs to a User, you would write `belongs_to :user`.

3. When you give custom names to the associations, you should still follow the above rules. The `:class_name` option is used to specify the model name when the name cannot be inferred from the association name. For example, if a User has many Comments, but the comments are actually stored in the Post model, you would write `has_many :comments, class_name: "Post"`.

Here's how you can set it up:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :posts
  has_many :comments, class_name: "Post"
end

class Post < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
end
```

In this setup, `user.posts` will give you all the posts that belong to a user, and `user.comments` will also give you all the posts that belong to a user, because we've set up a custom association name with `has_many :comments, class_name: "Post"`.
