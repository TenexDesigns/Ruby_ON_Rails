The naming convention for automatic and manual named associations in Rails is as follows:

* **Automatic named associations:** Rails will automatically infer the name of the association based on the name of the model. For example, if you have a `User` model and a `Post` model, Rails will automatically infer that the association between the two models is `has_many :posts`.
* **Manual named associations:** You can manually specify the name of the association using the `class_name` option. For example, if you want to give the association between the `User` model and the `Post` model a custom name of `comments`, you would use the following syntax:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :comments, class_name: "Post"
end
```

When to use `has_many :post` or `has_many :posts`:

* Use `has_many :post` when you have a one-to-one relationship between the two models. For example, a user can only have one profile picture.
* Use `has_many :posts` when you have a one-to-many relationship between the two models. For example, a user can have many posts.

When to use `belongs_to :user` or `belongs_to :users`:

* Use `belongs_to :user` when you have a one-to-one relationship between the two models. For example, a post can only belong to one user.
* Use `belongs_to :users` when you have a many-to-one relationship between the two models. For example, a comment can belong to many users.

When you give custom names to associations, you should use the plural form of the class name. For example, in the `User` model, the association `has_many :comments, class_name: "Post"` gives the association a custom name of `comments`.

Here are some examples of how to use the different naming conventions:

```ruby
# Automatic named association
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :posts
end

# Manual named association
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :comments, class_name: "Post"
end
```

```ruby
# One-to-one relationship
class User < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :profile_picture
end

# One-to-many relationship
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :posts
end

# Many-to-one relationship
class Comment < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
end
```

I hope this helps!
