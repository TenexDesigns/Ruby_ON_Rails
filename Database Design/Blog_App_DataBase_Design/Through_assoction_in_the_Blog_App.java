In the context of the code you provided for your blog app, the `through:` option in the `has_many` association is used to establish a connection between the `following` and `followers` associations and the `active_follows` and `passive_follows` associations. It's not used to refer to columns within the same table or model, but rather to create associations between models.

Here's how it works:

1. `has_many :active_follows, class_name: 'Follow'`:
   - This line establishes an association between the `User` model and the `Follow` model. It indicates that a user has many "active follows," meaning users they are following. The `class_name` option specifies that this association is based on the `Follow` model.

2. `has_many :following, through: :active_follows, source: :followed`:
   - This line establishes a `following` association for the `User` model through the `active_follows` association. It connects users with the users they are following. The `through:` option specifies the association that links the user to the followed users, and the `source:` option specifies which attribute within the `Follow` model represents the users being followed (i.e., `:followed`).

3. `has_many :passive_follows, class_name: 'Follow'`:
   - This line establishes an association between the `User` model and the `Follow` model for users who are followers. The `class_name` option specifies that this association is based on the `Follow` model.

4. `has_many :followers, through: :passive_follows, source: :follower`:
   - This line establishes a `followers` association for the `User` model through the `passive_follows` association. It connects users with the users who are following them (i.e., their followers). The `through:` option specifies the association that links the user to their followers, and the `source:` option specifies which attribute within the `Follow` model represents the followers (i.e., `:follower`).

In summary, the `through:` option is used to specify an intermediate association (in this case, `active_follows` and `passive_follows`) that connects two models (`User` and `Follow`) and allows you to navigate between them. It is a way to create more complex associations in Rails between models, providing flexibility in defining relationships between them.
