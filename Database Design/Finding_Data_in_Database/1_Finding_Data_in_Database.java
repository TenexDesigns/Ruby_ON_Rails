In Ruby on Rails, you have different ways to retrieve data from a database, and two of the main methods are `find` and `where`. Here's an explanation of these methods along with code samples:

1. **`find` Method**:
   - The `find` method is used to retrieve a record by its primary key (usually the ID).
   - If the record with the specified ID is found, it returns the record as a model object.
   - If the record is not found, it raises an `ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound` error.

   ```ruby
   # Retrieve a record by its ID
   user = User.find(1)  # Finds the User with ID 1
   ```

   ```ruby
   # Raises an error if the record is not found
   user = User.find(666)  # Raises ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound
   ```

2. **`find_by` and `find_by_{field_name}`**:
   - `find_by` and its variants are used to retrieve records based on specific field values.
   - They return the first matching record found, or `nil` if no record matches the criteria.

   ```ruby
   # Find a user by email
   user = User.find_by_email("scott@example.com")
   ```

   ```ruby
   # Find a user using a hash of conditions
   user = User.find_by(email: "scott@example.com")
   ```

   ```ruby
   # Returns nil if the record is not found
   user = User.find_by(email: "scott@example.com", is_public: false)
   ```

3. **`where` Method**:
   - The `where` method is used to retrieve a collection of records based on specified conditions.
   - It returns an `ActiveRecord::Relation`, which is an enumerable object.
   - If no records match the conditions, it returns an empty collection, not `nil`.

   ```ruby
   # Retrieve users where is_public is false
   users = User.where(is_public: false)
   ```

   ```ruby
   # Retrieve users with specific IDs (as an array)
   users = User.where(id: [1, 4])
   ```

   ```ruby
   # Retrieve users within a date range
   users = User.where(created_at: 1.day.ago..Time.current)
   ```

   ```ruby
   # Retrieve users based on multiple conditions
   users = User.where(is_public: true, created_at: 1.day.ago..Time.current)
   ```

4. **Chaining Queries**:
   - The `where` method can be chained with other `where` methods or ActiveRecord scopes for more complex queries.

   ```ruby
   users = User.where(is_public: true).where(created_at: 5.days.ago..Time.current)
   ```

5. **Logical OR and NOT**:
   - You can use `or` and `where.not` to perform logical OR and NOT operations on queries.

   ```ruby
   users = User.where(first_name: "Adam").or(User.where(first_name: "Scott"))
   ```

   ```ruby
   users = User.where.not(first_name: "Adam")
   ```

6. **Using SQL Queries**:
   - In some cases, you may need to write custom SQL queries. You can do this by passing a SQL string to the `where` method.

   ```ruby
   users = User.where("first_name ILIKE :search AND is_public = :is_public", {search: '%scott%', is_public: true})
   ```

   - Be cautious when using SQL queries, as it can open the door to SQL injection attacks. Always use placeholders and provide values in a hash to prevent SQL injection.

This should give you a good understanding of how to retrieve data in Ruby on Rails using the `find` and `where` methods, and how to chain and customize queries for your needs.
