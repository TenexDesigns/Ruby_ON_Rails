Transactions in Rails and ActiveRecord are used to ensure that a block of database operations are executed together. If any operation within the transaction fails, all operations within the transaction are rolled back, ensuring data integrity.

Here's a simple example of a transaction in Rails:

```ruby
ActiveRecord::Base.transaction do
  adam.withdraw!(some_amount)
  bryan.deposit!(some_amount)
end
```

In this example, `adam.withdraw!(some_amount)` and `bryan.deposit!(some_amount)` are executed within a transaction. If either operation fails, both operations are rolled back.

Transactions are particularly useful in scenarios where you need to ensure that multiple operations succeed or fail together. For example, in a money transfer operation, you would want to ensure that the withdrawal from one account and the deposit into another account either both succeed or both fail.

Nested transactions are also supported in Rails. In a nested transaction, if an inner transaction fails, it rolls back all changes made within its block, but the outer transaction continues to execute. Here's an example:

```ruby
Order.transaction do
  order.secure_items!
  Vendor.transaction(requires_new: true) do
    order.vendors.each(&:order_items!)
  end
  unless order.vendors.all_secured?
    raise ActiveRecord::Rollback
  end
  user.charge
end
```

In this example, if any vendor fails to order items, the inner transaction is rolled back, but the outer transaction continues to execute. If all vendors secure their items, the user is charged.

It's important to note that not all database systems support transactions, but most popular ones like PostgreSQL, MySQL, MS-SQL, and Oracle do. Also, when working with multiple databases, you should call `transaction` on the model that connects to the specific database you want to target, instead of on `ActiveRecord::Base`.

I hope this helps you understand transactions in Rails and ActiveRecord! Let me know if you have any further questions.
