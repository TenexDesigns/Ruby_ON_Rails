No, many-to-one and one-to-many relationships in database design are not the same.

A **many-to-one relationship** occurs when a row in one table can be referenced by multiple rows in another table. For example, a blog post can have many comments, but a comment can only belong to one blog post. This is represented by a foreign key constraint in the comments table that references the primary key in the blog posts table.

A **one-to-many relationship** is the opposite of a many-to-one relationship. It occurs when a row in one table can reference at most one row in another table. For example, a customer can have many orders, but an order can only belong to one customer. This is represented by a foreign key constraint in the orders table that references the primary key in the customers table.

Here is a diagram that illustrates the difference between many-to-one and one-to-many relationships:

```
Many-to-one:

Blog posts table:
id | title | body
-- | ---- | ----
1  | My first post | This is my first post!
2  | My second post | This is my second post!

Comments table:
id | body | post_id
-- | ---- | --------
1  | This is a comment on the first post. | 1
2  | This is a comment on the second post. | 2

One-to-many:

Customers table:
id | name | email
-- | ---- | -----
1  | John Doe | john.doe@example.com
2  | Jane Doe | jane.doe@example.com

Orders table:
id | customer_id | product_id
-- | ------------ | ----------
1  | 1           | 12345
2  | 1           | 54321
3  | 2           | 98765
```

As you can see, the many-to-one relationship between the blog posts and comments tables allows a blog post to have many comments, but a comment can only belong to one blog post. The one-to-many relationship between the customers and orders tables allows a customer to have many orders, but an order can only belong to one customer.

Many-to-one and one-to-many relationships are the most common types of relationships in database design. They are used to model a wide variety of real-world scenarios.
