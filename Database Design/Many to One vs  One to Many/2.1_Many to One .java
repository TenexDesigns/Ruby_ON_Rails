No, "many-to-one" and "one-to-many" are not the same in database design. They represent different types of relationships between entities in a database.

**Many-to-One Relationship:**
A many-to-one relationship, also known as a "belongs-to" relationship, occurs when multiple instances of one entity are associated with a single instance of another entity. In database design, this is typically represented by a foreign key in the "many" side of the relationship that references the primary key of the "one" side. For example, in a blog application, multiple comments can belong to a single blog post. The relationship between the Comment and Post entities would be a many-to-one relationship.

**One-to-Many Relationship:**
A one-to-many relationship, also known as a "has-many" relationship, occurs when a single instance of one entity is associated with multiple instances of another entity. In database design, this is typically represented by a foreign key in the "many" side of the relationship that references the primary key of the "one" side. For example, in a blog application, a single blog post can have multiple comments. The relationship between the Post and Comment entities would be a one-to-many relationship.

In summary, the main difference between many-to-one and one-to-many relationships is the direction of the relationship and the placement of the foreign key. In a many-to-one relationship, the foreign key is in the "many" side, while in a one-to-many relationship, the foreign key is in the "one" side.
