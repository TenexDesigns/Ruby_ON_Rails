Designing a database schema for a Rails application like Instagram involves defining models and their relationships. In this simplified example, I'll provide a basic structure for a Rails app with User, Post, Comment, and Follow models. You can start with this and expand it based on your requirements.

Let's start with the models and their associations:

1. **User Model:**
   - Attributes: `username`, `firstname`, `lastname`, `email`, `password`, and other user-related fields.
   - Relationships:
     - A user has many posts (posts they've created).
     - A user has many comments (comments they've made).
     - A user can follow other users.
     - A user can have followers (other users following them).

Here's a basic User model in Rails:

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :posts, dependent: :destroy
  has_many :comments, dependent: :destroy
  has_many :active_follows, class_name: "Follow", foreign_key: "follower_id", dependent: :destroy
  has_many :following, through: :active_follows, source: :followed
  has_many :passive_follows, class_name: "Follow", foreign_key: "followed_id", dependent: :destroy
  has_many :followers, through: :passive_follows, source: :follower
end
```

2. **Post Model:**
   - Attributes: `user_id`, `image`, `caption`, and other post-related fields.
   - Relationships:
     - A post belongs to a user.
     - A post has many comments.

Here's a basic Post model in Rails:

```ruby
# app/models/post.rb
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
  has_many :comments, dependent: :destroy
end
```

3. **Comment Model:**
   - Attributes: `user_id`, `post_id`, `content`, and other comment-related fields.
   - Relationships:
     - A comment belongs to a user and a post.

Here's a basic Comment model in Rails:

```ruby
# app/models/comment.rb
class Comment < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
  belongs_to :post
end
```

4. **Follow Model:**
   - Attributes: `follower_id` and `followed_id`.
   - Relationships:
     - A follow record belongs to a follower (user) and a followed user.

Here's a basic Follow model in Rails:

```ruby
# app/models/follow.rb
class Follow < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :follower, class_name: "User"
  belongs_to :followed, class_name: "User"
end
```

Remember to create corresponding database migrations to define the tables for these models. You can use the `rails generate migration` command to create migrations for each model.

After defining these models and their associations, you can run `rails db:migrate` to create the tables in the database. You can also create controllers and views to handle user registration, post creation, commenting, and following logic. Make sure to add proper validations and implement user authentication.

This is a simplified example to get you started. Instagram has more complex features like image uploads, likes, and more. You can expand the models and relationships as needed for your project.
