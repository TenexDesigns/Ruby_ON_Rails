The source attribute in Rails is used to specify the source association for a has_many :through association. This is useful when you need to create a many-to-many relationship between two models, but you need to go through a third model to do so.

For example, let's say you have a User model, a Post model, and a Comment model. You want to create a many-to-many relationship between users and posts, but you want to go through the Comment model to do so. This is because you want to track which user commented on which post.

To do this, you would create a has_many :through association on the User model, and you would use the source attribute to specify that the source association is comments. This means that Rails will go through the Comment model to find the posts that a user has commented on.

  In Rails associations, the `source` option is used to specify the source association or attribute from which the associated records should be retrieved when defining an association through another model.

In the context of your blog app, let's break down how the `source` option is used:

1. `has_many :following, through: :active_follows, source: :followed`:
   - The `has_many :following` association in the `User` model is defined to represent the users a specific user is following.
   - The `through: :active_follows` option specifies that this association is defined through the `active_follows` association.
   - The `source: :followed` option tells Rails to fetch the records associated with `:followed` attribute from the `active_follows` association. This means that, in the context of a `User`, the `:following` association is a collection of users who are being followed, and these users are retrieved from the `:followed` attribute in the `Follow` model. In other words, it's like saying, "I want to access the users being followed through the `active_follows` association, and I'll find them in the `:followed` attribute of the `Follow` model."

2. `has_many :followers, through: :passive_follows, source: :follower`:
   - The `has_many :followers` association in the `User` model is defined to represent the users who are following a specific user (i.e., the user's followers).
   - The `through: :passive_follows` option specifies that this association is defined through the `passive_follows` association.
   - The `source: :follower` option tells Rails to fetch the records associated with the `:follower` attribute from the `passive_follows` association. This means that, in the context of a `User`, the `:followers` association represents a collection of users who are followers of the user, and these users are retrieved from the `:follower` attribute in the `Follow` model.

So, in summary, the `source` option specifies the attribute within the associated model (in this case, the `Follow` model) that should be used to retrieve the associated records. It allows you to define more complex associations by specifying how to traverse through intermediate models to reach the desired records.
