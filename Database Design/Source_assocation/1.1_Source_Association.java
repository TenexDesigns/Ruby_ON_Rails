In Rails, the `:source` option is used in conjunction with `has_many :through` associations. It's used to specify the source association name when the name cannot be automatically inferred by Rails.

Let's say we have three models: `User`, `Course`, and `Enrollment`. A user can be enrolled in many courses, and a course can have many users. The `Enrollment` model serves as a join table between `User` and `Course`.

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :enrollments
  has_many :courses, through: :enrollments
end

class Course < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :enrollments
  has_many :users, through: :enrollments
end

class Enrollment < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
  belongs_to :course
end
```

In this setup, Rails can infer the source of the `has_many :through` association. When we say `has_many :courses, through: :enrollments`, Rails knows to look for a `course_id` in the `enrollments` table.

But imagine a slightly more complex scenario, where a `User` has many `instructors` (who are also users) through a `Course`. In this case, Rails can't automatically infer the source of the `instructors` association, because the `enrollments` table will have a `user_id`, but not an `instructor_id`. 

Here's how you could set it up with the `:source` option:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :enrollments
  has_many :courses, through: :enrollments
  has_many :instructed_courses, foreign_key: 'instructor_id', class_name: 'Course'
  has_many :students, through: :courses, source: :users
end

class Course < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :instructor, class_name: 'User'
  has_many :enrollments
  has_many :users, through: :enrollments
end

class Enrollment < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
  belongs_to :course
end
```

In the `User` model, `has_many :students, through: :courses, source: :users` tells Rails that the source of the `students` association is the `users` association on the `Course` model. Without this `:source` option, Rails would be looking for a `student_id` on the `courses` table, which doesn't exist.

So, in summary, the `:source` option is used to explicitly specify the source association name for a `has_many :through` association when it cannot be automatically inferred by Rails.
