Rails routing is a mechanism that connects incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate code in
your applications controllers and generates URLs without hard-coding them as strings guides.rubyonrails.org.
Routes are defined in the config/routes.rb file guides.rubyonrails.org.

Resourceful Style

The resourceful style is the preferred way to define routes in Rails. 
It uses the resources method to generate a set of named routes based on the controller and action names. For example:

# config/routes.rb
resources :posts
This generates the following routes:

GET /posts (index)
GET /posts/new (new)
POST /posts (create)
GET /posts/:id (show)
GET /posts/:id/edit (edit)
PUT/PATCH /posts/:id (update)
DELETE /posts/:id (destroy)
  
  
  
Match Style

The match style is an alternative to the resourceful style. It uses the match method to define routes explicitly. For example:

# config/routes.rb
match '/posts', to: 'posts#index', via: :get
match '/posts/new', to: 'posts#new', via: :get
match '/posts', to: 'posts#create', via: :post
match '/posts/:id', to: 'posts#show', via: :get
match '/posts/:id/edit', to: 'posts#edit', via: :get
match '/posts/:id', to: 'posts#update', via: :put
match '/posts/:id', to: 'posts#destroy', via: :delete
      
      
      
Constraints and Mounting Rack Endpoints

Rails routing supports constraints and mounting Rack endpoints, which can be used to define routes with specific
conditions or mount custom Rack applications guides.rubyonrails.org.

Route Parameters

Rails routing automatically picks up query string parameters and makes them available in the params hash. For example:

# config/routes.rb
get '/photos/show/:id', to: 'photos#show', as: :photo_show
With this route, an incoming URL of /photos/show/1?user_id=2 will be dispatched to the show action of the 
Photos controller. params[:id] will be set to 1, and params[:user_id] will be equal to 2 guides.rubyonrails.org.

Inspecting and Testing Routes

Rails offers built-in tools for inspecting and testing routes.
The rake routes command will output all the routes your application knows theodinproject.com.

In summary, Rails routing connects incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate code in your
applications controllers and helps generate URLs without hard-coding them as strings.
Routes are defined in the config/routes.rb file, and you can use resourceful style or match style to define routes.
Route parameters and constraints can be used to create more advanced routing scenarios.










MORE EXPLANATION
****************************************************************************************************************************


In Ruby on Rails, routing is the process of mapping incoming HTTP requests to controller actions in your application. 
The routes define the URLs that users can visit and the corresponding actions that should be executed.
Heres an explanation of routing in Rails with code samples:

Route Definition:
In the config/routes.rb file, you define the routes for your application.
Each route maps a URL pattern to a controller action. Here's an example:


Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get 'articles', to: 'articles#index'
  post 'articles', to: 'articles#create'
  get 'articles/new', to: 'articles#new'
  get 'articles/:id', to: 'articles#show', as: 'article'
  get 'articles/:id/edit', to: 'articles#edit', as: 'edit_article'
  patch 'articles/:id', to: 'articles#update'
  delete 'articles/:id', to: 'articles#destroy'
end
In the above code, different HTTP methods (get, post, patch, delete) are used along with the URL pattern 
and the corresponding controller action.

Controller and Action:
Each route is mapped to a controller and its action. The controller handles the logic and the action performs a specific task. 
For example, in the routes above,
the articles URL is mapped to the index action in the ArticlesController. Similarly, articles/:id is mapped to the show action.

Named Routes:
Using the as option in the route definition, you can assign a name to a route.
This creates a named route helper that can be used in your application. 
For example, as: 'article' creates a named route helper called article_path, which can be used to generate URLs.

URL Helpers:
Rails provides URL helper methods that you can use to generate URLs for your routes. 
These methods follow the naming conventions created by the routes. 
For example, article_path(id: 1) will generate the URL /articles/1.

RESTful Routes:
Rails encourages RESTful routing, which provides a consistent and predictable way to define routes
for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The resources method can be used to define RESTful routes for a resource.
For example:


Rails.application.routes.draw do
  resources :articles
end
This single line will generate all the necessary routes for CRUD operations on the articles resource.

Routing in Rails allows you to define the URLs for your application and map them to specific controller actions. 
It provides a clean and organized way to handle incoming requests. 
By following RESTful conventions, you can build efficient and maintainable applications.

****************************************************************************************************************************


Sure, here are some examples of how to use routing in Rails:

Simple routes:
Code snippet
# config/routes.rb

get "/hello", to: "pages#hello"
Use code with caution. Learn more
This route will map the URL /hello to the hello action in the PagesController.

Nested routes:
Code snippet
# config/routes.rb

get "/users/:id", to: "users#show"
Use code with caution. Learn more
This route will map the URL /users/1 to the show action in the UsersController.
The :id part of the route will be passed to the controller action as a parameter.

Wildcard routes:
Code snippet
# config/routes.rb

get "/products/*id", to: "products#show"
Use code with caution. Learn more
This route will map the URL /products/1 to the show action in the ProductsController. 
It will also map the URL /products/123 to the same action.
The *id part of the route will be passed to the controller action as a parameter.

Route constraints:
Code snippet
# config/routes.rb

get "/products/:id", to: "products#show", constraints: { id: /[0-9]+/ }
Use code with caution. Learn more
This route will only map the URL /products/1 to the show action in the ProductsController.
The id part of the route must be a number.

Redirecting routes:
Code snippet
# config/routes.rb

get "/products/:id", to: redirect("/products/index")
Use code with caution. Learn more
This route will redirect the user to the index action in the ProductsController when they visit the URL /products/1.

Named routes:
Code snippet
# config/routes.rb

get "/products/:id", to: "products#show", as: :product
Use code with caution. Learn more
This route will create a named route called product. You can then use this route name in your views and controllers.

RESTful routes:
Code snippet
# config/routes.rb

resources :products
Use code with caution. Learn more
This route will create all of the following routes:

GET /products
GET /products/new
POST /products
GET /products/:id
PATCH /products/:id
DELETE /products/:id
These routes follow the RESTful conventions, which makes your application more maintainable and easier to use.
