In Ruby on Rails, you have the option to use either Haml or ERB as the templating language for your views.
Both Haml and ERB have their own syntax and approach to generating HTML, and the choice between them often comes
down to personal preference or project requirements.
Heres a brief explanation of Haml and ERB, along with code samples to illustrate their syntax:

ERB (Embedded Ruby):
ERB is the default templating language in Rails and is closely integrated with Ruby.
It allows you to embed Ruby code within HTML markup using special tags. ERB files typically have a .html.erb extension.

Example ERB code:


<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome, <%= @user.name %></h1>
    <% if @user.admin? %>
      <p>You have admin privileges.</p>
    <% else %>
      <p>You have regular user privileges.</p>
    <% end %>
  </body>
</html>
Haml:
Haml is an alternative templating language that aims to be more concise and visually appealing by using 
indentation rather than HTML tags. It does not require explicit opening and closing tags,
and instead uses indentation to determine the structure of the HTML.
Haml files typically have a .html.haml extension.

Example Haml code:

haml
Copy code
%html
  %body
    %h1 Welcome, #{@user.name}
    - if @user.admin?
      %p You have admin privileges.
    - else
      %p You have regular user privileges.
As you can see, Haml uses indentation to define the structure and nesting of HTML elements,
while ERB uses explicit opening and closing tags. Haml aims to provide a more streamlined and readable syntax,
while ERB maintains a more familiar HTML-like syntax with embedded Ruby code.

Ultimately, the choice between Haml and ERB comes down to personal preference and the requirements of your project. 
Its worth noting that Haml can be a good choice if you prefer a more concise and visually appealing syntax,
while ERB provides a more familiar HTML-like approach. Rails supports both options,
allowing you to choose the one that fits your needs best.









MORE EXPLANATION
*************************************************************************************************************************8


In the context of Rails, there are two popular templating languages: ERB (Embedded Ruby) and Haml.
  Both languages allow you to mix Ruby code with HTML, but they have different syntax and characteristics.

ERB (Embedded Ruby)

ERB is the default templating language in Rails. It allows you to embed Ruby code within an HTML document 
using <% and %> delimiters. Heres a simple example:

<% @items.each do |item| %>
  <p><%= item.name %></p>
<% end %>
Haml

Haml is an alternative to ERB that eliminates the need for <% and %> delimiters and uses indentation to mark
the beginning and end of markup.
This makes the code cleaner and easier to read. Heres the same example in Haml:

- @items.each do |item|
  %p= item.name
Comparison and Trade-offs

Syntax: Haml has a cleaner and more concise syntax compared to ERB, which can improve readability and maintainability of
  the code. haml.info
Performance: ERB is generally faster than Haml, as it doesnt require any additional gems.
  However, the performance difference may not be significant in most cases. testsuite.io
Learning curve: Hamls syntax may be easier to learn for some developers, while others may prefer
  the familiarity of ERB. stackshare.io
Converting between ERB and Haml

You can convert ERB templates to Haml using online converters or the html2haml gem. 
To convert Haml to ERB, you can use the haml2erb API with the httparty gem, as shown in the following code snippet:

require "httparty"
haml = File.read("demo.haml")
response = HTTParty.post "https://haml2erb.org/api/convert", {
  body: {
    converter: "herbalizer",
    haml: haml
  }
}
puts JSON.parse(response.body)["erb"]

Setting Up Haml in Rails

To add Haml to an existing Rails project, youll need to include the haml-rails gem in your Gemfile:

gem 'haml-rails', '>= 0.3.4', :group => :development
Then, run bundle install. With the haml-rails gem, there is no need to modify the application.rb 
file to accommodate Haml. railsapps.github.io

Performance Benchmarks

In a performance comparison between ERB, Haml, and Slim, ERB consistently came out on top. 
However, the performance difference may not be significant in most cases, and other factors such as syntax 
preference and readability should also be considered. honeybadger.io

In conclusion, both ERB and Haml have their strengths and weaknesses.
While ERB is faster and more familiar to many developers, Haml offers a cleaner and more concise syntax.
The choice between the two depends on your project requirements and personal preferences.

ERB and HAML are both templating languages that can be used in Rails. ERB is the default templating language in Rails,
while HAML is an alternative that is becoming increasingly popular.

ERB is a classic templating language that uses HTML mixed with Ruby code. 
It is easy to learn and use, and it is compatible with all versions of Rails.
However, ERB can be verbose and difficult to read, especially for large and complex templates.

HAML is a newer templating language that is designed to be more concise and readable than ERB.
It uses a markdown-like syntax that is easy to learn and understand. HAML is also faster than ERB
, and it can be used to generate smaller and more efficient HTML files.

Here is an example of an ERB template:

Code snippet
<%= form_for @product do |f| %>
  <div class="field">
    <%= f.label :name %>
    <%= f.text_field :name %>
  </div>

  <div class="actions">
    <%= f.submit %>
  </div>
<% end %>
Use code with caution. Learn more
Here is the same template written in HAML:

Code snippet
= form_for @product do |f|
  .field
    = f.label :name
    = f.text_field :name

  .actions
    = f.submit
Use code with caution. Learn more
As you can see, HAML is much more concise and readable than ERB.

Which templating language should you use?

If you are new to Rails, I would recommend using ERB. It is easy to learn and use, and it is compatible with all versions of Rails. However, if you are looking for a more concise and readable templating language, I would recommend using HAML. HAML is faster than ERB, and it can be used to generate smaller and more efficient HTML files.

Ultimately, the decision of which templating language to use is up to you. Consider your needs and preferences, and choose the language that you think will be the best fit for your project.
