Callbacks in Ruby on Rails are methods that get executed at specific points during the lifecycle of an object. They are used to add custom logic, enforce business rules, and perform various actions at different stages of an object's lifecycle. Callbacks are primarily associated with models but can also be used in controllers and other parts of the Rails application.

Here's an overview of how callbacks work in Rails:

1. **Common Use Cases for Callbacks**:
   - Validations: Ensure data is valid before saving it to the database.
   - Associations: Manage associations and related records when creating, updating, or destroying a model instance.
   - Custom Actions: Execute custom logic or perform actions such as sending emails, notifications, or creating related records when a specific event occurs.

2. **Categories of Callbacks**:
   Callbacks in Rails are categorized based on when they are triggered in the object's lifecycle. The three main categories are:
   - **Before Callbacks**: Executed before a specific event, such as before saving, creating, updating, or destroying an object.
   - **After Callbacks**: Executed after a specific event, such as after saving, creating, updating, or destroying an object.
   - **Around Callbacks**: Wrap a specific event, allowing you to perform actions before and after the event.

3. **Where to Use Callbacks**:
   - **Models**: Callbacks are most commonly used in Rails models to execute logic before or after certain events in the model's lifecycle, such as creation, validation, saving, updating, or destruction.
   - **Controllers**: In controllers, you can use `before_action` and `after_action` callbacks to execute custom logic before or after controller actions, affecting the request/response cycle.
   - **Services**: You can use callbacks in service objects, which are plain Ruby classes, to encapsulate complex business logic and invoke callbacks within the service methods.

4. **Examples of Callbacks**:
   Here are some common examples of callbacks:

   - **Before Callbacks**:
     - `before_validation`
     - `before_save`
     - `before_create`
     - `before_update`
     - `before_destroy`

   - **After Callbacks**:
     - `after_validation`
     - `after_save`
     - `after_create`
     - `after_update`
     - `after_destroy`

   - **Around Callbacks**:
     - `around_save`
     - `around_create`
     - `around_update`
     - `around_destroy`

5. **Custom Callbacks**:
   You can also define your own custom callbacks when none of the built-in callback types meet your specific needs.

Callbacks are a powerful tool in Rails for encapsulating and executing custom logic at various points in an object's lifecycle. They help keep your code organized, maintainable, and adhere to the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle by encapsulating common logic in a reusable manner. While they are often used with models, callbacks can be used in other parts of the Rails application as needed.
