You can use callbacks in services in Rails to encapsulate complex business logic and invoke callbacks within the service methods. This can be useful for a number of reasons, including:

* **Modularity:** Callbacks can help you to modularize your code by allowing you to define reusable chunks of logic in separate service objects. This can make your code more maintainable and easier to test.
* **Reusability:** Callbacks can be reused across multiple service objects, which can save you time and code duplication.
* **Encapsulation:** Callbacks can be used to encapsulate the implementation details of your business logic, making your code more readable and less error-prone.

**How to use callbacks in services**

To use callbacks in a service, you simply need to define a method on your service object with the name of the callback. For example, to define a before_create callback, you would define a method called `before_create`.

When the callback is triggered, the Rails framework will automatically call the method. You can then use the method to execute any code that you need.

**Which callbacks can be used outside of models and controllers and inside services?**

All of the callbacks that are available for models and controllers can also be used in services. This includes:

* Validation callbacks
* Database transaction callbacks
* Before and after callbacks for CRUD operations
* Before and after callbacks for request-response stages

**Example**

The following example shows how to use a callback in a service object to send an email after a new user is created:

```ruby
class UserService
  def create(user)
    user.save!
    notify_new_user(user)
  end

  private

  def notify_new_user(user)
    # Send an email to the new user
    UserMailer.welcome(user).deliver_now
  end
end
```

In this example, the `notify_new_user` callback is called after the user is saved to the database. This ensures that the email is only sent if the user is successfully created.

**Conclusion**

Callbacks can be a powerful tool for encapsulating complex business logic and invoking reusable code in Rails services. By using callbacks, you can make your code more modular, reusable, and maintainable.
