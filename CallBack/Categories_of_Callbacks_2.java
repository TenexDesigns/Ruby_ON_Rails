**Callbacks in Rails**

Callbacks are methods that are called automatically at certain points in the lifecycle of an object. They can be used to execute custom code before, after, or around events such as creating, saving, updating, or deleting an object.

Callbacks are available for both models and controllers. For models, there are callbacks for all of the CRUD operations (create, read, update, and delete), as well as callbacks for validation and database transactions. For controllers, there are callbacks for the different stages of the request-response cycle, such as before and after actions, and before and after rendering.

**How to use callbacks**

To use a callback, you simply define a method on your model or controller with the name of the callback. For example, to define a before_save callback on a model, you would define a method called `before_save`.

When the callback is triggered, the Rails framework will automatically call the method. You can then use the method to execute any code that you need.

**Where to use callbacks**

Callbacks can be used in a variety of places in your Rails application. Here are a few examples:

* **Validating data:** You can use callbacks to validate data before it is saved to the database. For example, you could use a before_save callback to check that the required fields are filled in or that the data is in the correct format.
* **Sending emails:** You can use callbacks to send emails automatically when certain events occur. For example, you could use an after_create callback to send an email to a new user when they sign up for your application.
* **Updating related objects:** You can use callbacks to update related objects when a model is saved. For example, you could use an after_save callback to update the parent object when a child object is saved.
* **Caching data:** You can use callbacks to cache data automatically. For example, you could use an after_save callback to cache the updated model data so that it can be retrieved quickly on the next request.

**Are callbacks divided into categories?**

Yes, callbacks are divided into two categories:

* **Before callbacks:** These callbacks are executed before the event occurs. For example, the before_save callback is executed before the model is saved to the database.
* **After callbacks:** These callbacks are executed after the event occurs. For example, the after_save callback is executed after the model is saved to the database.

**Are there callbacks specifically for models or controllers?**

Yes, there are callbacks specifically for models and controllers. There are also callbacks that are specific to certain events, such as validation callbacks and database transaction callbacks.

**Are callbacks global or limited in their areas of use?**

Callbacks are limited in their areas of use. They can only be used on models and controllers. However, they can be used on any model or controller, regardless of the purpose of the model or controller.

**Conclusion**

Callbacks are a powerful tool that can be used to automate common tasks in Rails applications. By using callbacks, you can reduce the amount of boilerplate code that you need to write and make your code more concise and readable.
