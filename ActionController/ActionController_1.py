ActionController is an integral part of the Ruby on Rails framework and serves as the controller component 
responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and generating appropriate responses.
It provides a set of classes and modules that facilitate request processing, parameter handling,
session management, and response generation.

Here are some key aspects of ActionController:

Routing: ActionController works in conjunction with the Rails router to map incoming requests to specific controller 
actions. 
  The router determines which controller and action should handle a particular URL.

Controller Actions: Controllers in Rails are Ruby classes that inherit from ActionController::Base. 
Each controller consists of individual action methods that correspond to different routes
and HTTP verbs (e.g., index, create, show, update, destroy).

class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def index
    # Retrieve all users and render a response
  end

  def create
    # Create a new user based on the request parameters
  end

  def show
    # Retrieve and render a specific user based on the request parameters
  end

  def update
    # Update a specific user based on the request parameters
  end

  def destroy
    # Delete a specific user based on the request parameters
  end
end
Request and Response: ActionController provides various methods and objects to access the request
  data (e.g., parameters, headers) and generate appropriate responses (e.g., rendering views, redirecting, returning JSON,
setting cookies).

Filters: Filters are used to perform certain actions before, after, or around controller actions.
  Filters allow you to modify the request or response, handle authentication, caching, and other cross-cutting concerns.

Session Management: ActionController facilitates session management,
  allowing you to store and retrieve data associated with a particular users session. 
  The session object provides a hash-like interface to work with session data.

Rendering Views: ActionController supports rendering views, allowing you to generate HTML, JSON,
  XML, or other formats as a response. Views are typically written using a templating language such as ERB or Haml.

URL Generation: ActionController provides URL generation helpers to generate URLs for specific routes or controller actions.
  These helpers ensure consistent and RESTful URLs throughout the application.

ActionController is the bridge between the HTTP request and the application logic. 
It receives requests, performs any necessary processing or manipulation,
interacts with models through ActiveRecord, and generates appropriate responses.

Overall, ActionController is a fundamental component of Rails that handles the business logic and flow control
for incoming HTTP requests, helping you build robust and maintainable web applications.
