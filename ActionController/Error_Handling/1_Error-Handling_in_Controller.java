Error handling is an essential part of any application. It helps to provide a better user experience by ensuring that the application can gracefully handle unexpected situations and provide meaningful feedback to the user. In Rails, you can handle errors at the controller level using various techniques. 

Here are some examples:

1. **Using conditional statements to handle validation errors:**

   This is a simple and straightforward method to handle errors in Rails. After trying to save a record, you can check if the record is valid and if not, return the errors.

   ```ruby
   class UsersController < ApplicationController
     def create
       @user = User.new(user_params)
       if @user.save
         render json: @user, status: :created
       else
         render json: @user.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity
       end
     end
     private
     def user_params
       params.require(:user).permit(:name, :email)
     end
   end
   ```
   In this example, if the user is successfully saved, it returns the user data with a status of `:created`. If there are validation errors, it returns the errors with a status of `:unprocessable_entity`.

2. **Using `rescue_from` to handle exceptions:**

   Rails provides a `rescue_from` method that you can use to rescue from a specific exception type.

   ```ruby
   class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
     rescue_from ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound, with: :record_not_found

     private
     def record_not_found
       render json: { message: 'Record not found' }, status: :not_found
     end
   end
   ```
   In this example, if an `ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound` exception is raised in any of the controllers inheriting from `ApplicationController`, the `record_not_found` method is called which renders a JSON response with a status of `:not_found`.

3. **Using the `!` version of methods that raise exceptions**

   In Rails, methods like `create`, `update`, `save`, `find` etc., have a counterpart with a `!` that raises an exception when the operation fails. You can use these methods with a `rescue` block to handle exceptions.

   ```ruby
   class UsersController < ApplicationController
     def create
       @user = User.create!(user_params)
       render json: @user, status: :created
     rescue ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid => e
       render json: { errors: e.record.errors }, status: :unprocessable_entity
     end
     private
     def user_params
       params.require(:user).permit(:name, :email)
     end
   end
   ```
   In this example, if the user fails to save, `create!` raises an `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` exception, which is then rescued and the errors are returned with a status of `:unprocessable_entity`.

These are just a few ways to handle errors in Rails controllers. The best method to use depends on your specific requirements and the nature of the errors you expect to encounter.
