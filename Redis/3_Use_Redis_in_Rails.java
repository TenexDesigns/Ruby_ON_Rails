Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure store that can be used as a database, cache, and message broker. In a Rails application, it's often used for caching, session storage, and as a queue for background jobs.

Here's a basic guide to using Redis as a cache in a Rails application:

### Step 1: Install Redis

First, you need to install Redis on your system. You can follow the instructions on the official [Redis website](https://redis.io/download).

### Step 2: Add the Redis Gem

Add the `redis` gem to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'redis'
```

Then run `bundle install` to install the gem.

### Step 3: Configure Redis

In `config/environments/production.rb`, configure Redis as the cache store:

```ruby
config.cache_store = :redis_store, "redis://localhost:6379/0/cache", { expires_in: 90.minutes }
```

Replace `"redis://localhost:6379/0/cache"` with the URL of your Redis server.

### Step 4: Use Redis for Caching

Now you can use Redis for caching. For example, to cache the result of an expensive method:

```ruby
def expensive_method
  Rails.cache.fetch('expensive_method', expires_in: 12.hours) do
    # Your expensive operation here
  end
end
```

In this example, the result of `expensive_method` will be stored in the Redis cache for 12 hours.

### Using Redis for Session Storage

You can also use Redis for session storage. In `config/initializers/session_store.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.session_store :redis_store, servers: ["redis://localhost:6379/0/session"]
```

Again, replace `"redis://localhost:6379/0/session"` with the URL of your Redis server.

### Using Redis for Background Jobs

If you're using Sidekiq for background jobs, you're already using Redis, as Sidekiq uses Redis as a job queue.

Remember to start your Redis server before starting your Rails server. You can start the Redis server with the `redis-server` command.

This is a basic introduction to using Redis in a Rails application. Depending on your needs, you might want to use other features of Redis, like sorted sets, publish/subscribe, or transactions [Source 0](https://dev.to/hixdevs/running-your-rails-projects-with-redis-all-you-need-to-know-360a), [Source 1](https://www.sitepoint.com/introduction-to-using-redis-with-rails/), [Source 4](https://medium.com/@nycmarcopolo/implementing-redis-into-your-rails-application-c57f44f80b73).
