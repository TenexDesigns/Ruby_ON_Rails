In Ruby on Rails, you can update attributes of a record in the database using the ActiveRecord ORM. The typical steps for updating attributes in Rails are as follows:

1. Find the Record:
   First, you need to find the record you want to update. You can do this using methods like `find`, `find_by`, or `where`, depending on your specific use case.

   ```ruby
   # Example: Find a user with ID 1
   user = User.find(1)
   ```

2. Update the Attributes:
   Once you have the record, you can update its attributes by assigning new values to them. You can either update individual attributes one by one or use the `update` method to update multiple attributes at once.

   **Updating Individual Attributes:**

   ```ruby
   # Update a single attribute
   user.name = "New Name"
   user.email = "new_email@example.com"

   # Save the changes to the database
   user.save
   ```

   **Using the `update` Method:**

   ```ruby
   # Update multiple attributes at once
   user.update(name: "New Name", email: "new_email@example.com")
   ```

   The `update` method is a convenient way to update multiple attributes in a single call and automatically saves the changes to the database.

3. Error Handling:
   When you update attributes, you should handle potential errors. If validation fails, the `save` or `update` method will return `false`, and you can check for validation errors using the `errors` object.

   ```ruby
   if user.update(name: "New Name", email: "invalid_email")
     # Update successful
   else
     # Handle validation errors
     errors = user.errors.full_messages
     # Do something with the errors
   end
   ```

4. Database Commit:
   The changes to the record will only be persisted in the database when you call `save` or `update`. The `update` method automatically performs the commit, while with `save`, you need to explicitly call `save` to persist the changes.

Here's a complete example:

```ruby
# Find the record you want to update
user = User.find(1)

# Update attributes
user.name = "New Name"
user.email = "new_email@example.com"

# Save the changes to the database
if user.save
  # Update successful
else
  # Handle validation errors
  errors = user.errors.full_messages
  # Do something with the errors
end
```

Remember that the exact attribute names, validation rules, and error handling may vary depending on your specific Rails application and model setup. Make sure to adapt the code to your application's needs and follow Rails conventions and best practices.
