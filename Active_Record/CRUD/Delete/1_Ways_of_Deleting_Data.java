In Ruby on Rails, you can delete data from a database using the ActiveRecord ORM in a few different ways. Here are the common methods for deleting records:

1. `destroy` Method:
   The `destroy` method is used to delete a specific record (an instance of a model) by calling it on that instance. It not only removes the record from the database but also runs any associated callbacks and validations.

   ```ruby
   user = User.find(1) # Find the user you want to delete
   user.destroy # Deletes the user record from the database
   ```

   The `destroy` method is commonly used when you want to ensure that any associated records, if defined in your model, are also properly cleaned up.

2. `delete` Method:
   The `delete` method is used to delete records without running callbacks and validations. It's a faster method for bulk deletion and doesn't execute any callbacks.

   ```ruby
   User.where(age: 20).delete_all # Deletes all users with age 20 without callbacks
   ```

   The `delete` method should be used with caution because it doesn't trigger the same lifecycle events as `destroy`, which might be necessary in certain cases.

3. `destroy` and `delete` with Conditions:
   You can delete records that match specific conditions using the `destroy` and `delete` methods with query conditions. For example:

   ```ruby
   User.where("age < 18").destroy_all # Delete all users under 18 with callbacks
   User.where("age >= 18").delete_all # Delete all users 18 and older without callbacks
   ```

4. `delete_by` and `destroy_by`:
   Starting from Rails 6, you can use the `delete_by` and `destroy_by` methods to delete a single record that matches a condition:

   ```ruby
   User.delete_by(name: "John") # Delete the first user named "John" without callbacks
   User.destroy_by(name: "Jane") # Delete the first user named "Jane" with callbacks
   ```

5. `delete_all` and `destroy_all`:
   You can delete multiple records that match a condition using the `delete_all` and `destroy_all` methods:

   ```ruby
   User.where(age: 25).delete_all # Delete all users with age 25 without callbacks
   User.where(age: 30).destroy_all # Delete all users with age 30 with callbacks
   ```

6. `destroy` and `delete` with ID:
   You can delete a record by its ID using the `destroy` and `delete` methods:

   ```ruby
   User.destroy(1) # Delete the user with ID 1 with callbacks
   User.delete(2)  # Delete the user with ID 2 without callbacks
   ```

These are some common ways to delete data in Ruby on Rails using the ActiveRecord ORM. The choice of method depends on your specific use case and whether you want to trigger callbacks and validations during the deletion process. Always be cautious when deleting data to avoid unintended data loss.
