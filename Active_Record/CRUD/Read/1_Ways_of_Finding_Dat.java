In Ruby on Rails, you can find data in a database using the ActiveRecord ORM in various ways. Here are some common methods and techniques for querying data:

1. `find` Method:
   You can use the `find` method to retrieve a single record by its primary key (usually `id`), or an array of primary keys. This method raises an exception if the record is not found.

   ```ruby
   user = User.find(1) # Find a user with ID 1
   users = User.find([1, 2, 3]) # Find multiple users by their IDs
   ```

2. `find_by` and `find_by!` Methods:
   The `find_by` and `find_by!` methods allow you to find the first record that matches a specific condition. `find_by` returns `nil` if no record is found, while `find_by!` raises an exception.

   ```ruby
   user = User.find_by(email: "example@example.com")
   user = User.find_by!(email: "example@example.com")
   ```

3. `where` Method:
   The `where` method is used for more complex queries. It returns an `ActiveRecord::Relation` object that can be further chained with other query methods.

   ```ruby
   users = User.where(age: 25)
   users = User.where("age >= ? AND created_at > ?", 25, 1.week.ago)
   ```

4. `find_or_create_by` and `find_or_create_by!` Methods:
   These methods find a record that matches the given condition and creates it if it doesn't exist. `find_or_create_by` returns the record or a new record if it doesn't exist, while `find_or_create_by!` raises an exception if it can't create the record.

   ```ruby
   user = User.find_or_create_by(email: "newuser@example.com")
   user = User.find_or_create_by!(email: "newuser@example.com")
   ```

5. `pluck` Method:
   The `pluck` method is used to retrieve specific attributes of matching records in the form of an array.

   ```ruby
   user_emails = User.where(age: 25).pluck(:email)
   ```

6. `order` Method:
   You can use the `order` method to specify the order in which records are retrieved.

   ```ruby
   users = User.order(created_at: :desc)
   ```

7. Scopes:
   Scopes are custom query methods defined within your model. They allow you to encapsulate and reuse specific query logic.

   ```ruby
   class User < ApplicationRecord
     scope :adults, -> { where("age >= 18") }
   end

   adults = User.adults
   ```

8. SQL Query:
   You can execute raw SQL queries using the `find_by_sql` method or other query methods. Be cautious when using raw SQL to prevent SQL injection.

   ```ruby
   users = User.find_by_sql("SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 20")
   ```

These are some common methods and techniques for finding data in Ruby on Rails using the ActiveRecord ORM. The choice of method depends on your specific query requirements and the complexity of your search criteria.
