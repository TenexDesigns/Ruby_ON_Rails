In Ruby on Rails, you can create data in the database using the ActiveRecord ORM in several ways. Here are common methods and techniques for creating records:

1. `new` and `save` Methods:
   You can create a new instance of a model using the `new` method, assign attribute values, and then save the record to the database using the `save` method.

   ```ruby
   user = User.new(name: "John", email: "john@example.com")
   user.save
   ```

   You can also create and save a record in one step using `create`:

   ```ruby
   user = User.create(name: "John", email: "john@example.com")
   ```

2. `create` Method:
   The `create` method creates and saves a new record in one step. It's a convenient way to create a record with initial attribute values.

   ```ruby
   User.create(name: "John", email: "john@example.com")
   ```

3. `new` with Block:
   You can use the `new` method with a block to create a new record and assign attributes within the block before saving it.

   ```ruby
   user = User.new do |u|
     u.name = "John"
     u.email = "john@example.com"
   end
   user.save
   ```

4. `build` and Association:
   When working with associations, you can use the `build` method to create associated records and associate them with a parent record before saving.

   ```ruby
   post = Post.find(1)
   comment = post.comments.build(body: "A new comment")
   comment.save
   ```

   This example creates a comment associated with a post.

5. `create!` Method:
   The `create!` method is similar to `create` but raises an exception if validation fails or if the record cannot be saved.

   ```ruby
   User.create!(name: "John", email: "invalid_email") # Raises an exception if validation fails
   ```

6. Batch Inserts:
   For bulk inserts, you can use the `insert_all` method to insert multiple records in a single database query. This method is faster but does not run validations or callbacks.

   ```ruby
   User.insert_all([{ name: "User1" }, { name: "User2" }])
   ```

7. `save` with `assign_attributes`:
   You can use `assign_attributes` to update attribute values in memory and then save the record with the new values.

   ```ruby
   user = User.find(1)
   user.assign_attributes(name: "New Name", email: "new_email@example.com")
   user.save
   ```

These are common methods and techniques for creating data in Ruby on Rails using the ActiveRecord ORM. The choice of method depends on your specific creation requirements and whether you need to run validations and callbacks during the creation process.
