Joins and includes are both used to retrieve data from multiple tables in a Rails application. However, they have different implications for performance.

**Joins**

A join is a SQL operation that combines two or more tables based on a common field. For example, the following join would retrieve all books and their associated authors:

```sql
SELECT books.*, authors.name
FROM books
JOIN authors ON books.author_id = authors.id
```

Joins can be very powerful, but they can also be slow, especially if you are retrieving a large amount of data.
However, it does not load the associated records into memory as separate objects. Instead, it returns a combined result set that includes columns from both tables.
For example, if you have a Book model that belongs to an Author model, you can use joins to retrieve books along with their associated authors:

books = Book.joins(:author)
   
This will execute an SQL join query that retrieves books and their associated authors. However, the result will be a combined result set, and you won't be able to directly access the author objects as separate entities.

   

**Includes**

Includes is an ActiveRecord feature that allows you to eagerly load associated records. This means that ActiveRecord will retrieve all of the associated records in advance, instead of making a separate query for each associated record.

For example, the following code would eagerly load all of the associated authors for the `books` variable:

```ruby
books = Book.includes(:author)

   
The includes method, on the other hand, performs eager loading of associated records. It retrieves the main records and their associated records in a single query,
   and it loads the associated records into memory as separate objects. This can help avoid the N+1 query problem, where multiple queries are executed to retrieve associated records for each main record.



   This will execute a query that retrieves books and their associated authors, and it will load the authors into memory as separate objects. This allows you to directly access the author objects and perform operations on them.

   
   

Includes can significantly improve the performance of your application, especially if you are retrieving a large amount of data from multiple tables.




   
**Which one should you use?**


In summary, joins performs an SQL join and returns a combined result set, while includes performs eager loading and loads associated records into memory as separate objects. The choice between joins and includes depends on your 
   specific use case and whether you need to access the associated records as separate objects or just retrieve a combined result set.



   

In general, you should use includes whenever possible. It is more efficient and easier to use than joins. However, there are some cases where you may need to use a join:

* If you need to filter the associated records. For example, the following code would retrieve all books with an author named "J.K. Rowling":

```ruby
books = Book.joins(:author).where(authors: { name: 'J.K. Rowling' })
```

* If you need to sort the associated records. For example, the following code would retrieve all books ordered by the author's name:

```ruby
books = Book.joins(:author).order('authors.name ASC')
```

If you are unsure which one to use, it is always best to consult the Rails documentation or ask for help from a more experienced developer.

Certainly! Here's an explanation of these Active Record methods with code samples:

1. **Joins:**
   The `joins` method is used to retrieve records based on associations between models. It performs an SQL JOIN operation to fetch related records from associated tables.

   ```ruby
   users = User.joins(:posts)
   ```
   This code retrieves all users who have associated posts. It joins the `users` and `posts` tables and returns users with their associated posts.

2. **Eager Loading Associations:**
   The `includes` method is used for eager loading associations. It helps prevent the N+1 query problem by fetching associated records in a more efficient way, reducing the number of database queries.

   ```ruby
   users = User.includes(:posts)
   ```
   This code retrieves users and eagerly loads their associated posts, so you can access them without triggering additional queries when you access the posts.

3. **Aggregations:**
   Aggregation methods like `average` are used to perform calculations on a specific attribute within a table. In this example, it calculates the average age of users.

   ```ruby
   average_age = User.average(:age)
   ```

4. **Grouping and Counting:**
   The `group` and `count` methods are used to group records by a specific attribute and count the occurrences in each group.

   ```ruby
   users_by_age = User.group(:age).count
   ```
   This code groups users by their ages and counts how many users are in each age group.

These methods provide powerful capabilities for working with your data efficiently in Rails. They help you query and manipulate your database records using a high-level, Ruby-based syntax, making it more intuitive and developer-friendly than writing raw SQL queries.

No, `joins` and `includes` serve different purposes in the context of Active Record queries.

1. **Joins:**
   - `joins` is used to perform SQL JOIN operations and retrieve records based on associations between models. It explicitly specifies how the tables should be joined in the SQL query.
   - It returns a combined result set, including columns from both the primary and associated tables.
   - Use `joins` when you want to filter records based on associations and include columns from both tables.

   Example:
   ```ruby
   users = User.joins(:posts)
   ```

2. **Includes:**
   - `includes` is used for eager loading associations. It retrieves the main records along with their associated records efficiently to avoid the N+1 query problem.
   - It loads the associated records into memory so that you can access them without triggering additional database queries.
   - Use `includes` when you want to load associated records and minimize the number of database queries, especially when you plan to access the associated data.

   Example:
   ```ruby
   users = User.includes(:posts)
   ```

In summary, `joins` is used for querying based on associations and returns a single result set with columns from both tables. On the other hand, `includes` is used for eager loading associated records, which helps reduce the number of queries when you access the associated data. They have different use cases and outcomes.
