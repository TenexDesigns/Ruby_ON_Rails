Using Active Record ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) and writing raw SQL queries are two different approaches to interacting with databases in Rails and backend development in general. Each approach has its pros and cons, and the choice between them depends on your specific project requirements and preferences. Let's explore the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches:

**Active Record ORM:**

Pros:
1. **Abstraction:** Active Record provides an object-oriented abstraction over your database schema. You interact with your data as objects rather than writing SQL queries directly.

2. **Readability:** Active Record code can be more readable and closer to the business logic, making it easier for developers to understand and maintain.

3. **Database Agnosticism:** Active Record abstracts away the specific database system you are using, allowing you to switch between different database systems with minimal code changes.

4. **Automatic Query Generation:** Active Record generates SQL queries for you, reducing the need to write raw SQL for common operations.

5. **Validations and Callbacks:** Active Record provides built-in support for data validation and lifecycle callbacks, making it easier to ensure data integrity.

6. **Security:** Active Record helps protect against SQL injection by escaping data properly.

Cons:
1. **Performance Overhead:** The abstraction layer can introduce some performance overhead compared to writing optimized raw SQL queries.

2. **Complex Queries:** Writing complex and optimized queries may be challenging in Active Record, and you might need to resort to raw SQL for some operations.

3. **Learning Curve:** Learning the Active Record conventions and APIs can take some time, especially for newcomers.

**Raw Bare Bones SQL:**

Pros:
1. **Performance:** Writing raw SQL queries gives you more control over query optimization, which can result in better performance for complex operations.

2. **Flexibility:** You have full control over your SQL statements, making it easier to implement custom and intricate queries.

3. **Database-Specific Features:** You can take advantage of database-specific features and functions that may not be available through Active Record.

4. **Familiarity:** Developers with a background in database development and SQL may find raw SQL more intuitive and efficient.

Cons:
1. **Readability:** SQL queries can be less readable and may require additional comments to explain their purpose.

2. **Maintenance:** Writing raw SQL queries may require more effort for maintaining your codebase as changes in the database schema can affect many parts of the application.

3. **SQL Injection:** You need to be extra careful when handling user input in raw SQL to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

4. **Database Portability:** If you switch to a different database system, you might need to rewrite or adapt your SQL queries.

In summary, the choice between Active Record ORM and raw SQL depends on your project's requirements. For simpler applications with straightforward database interactions, Active Record can save time and make your code more maintainable. However, for complex operations, optimized queries, and scenarios where performance is crucial, raw SQL may be a better choice. In some cases, a hybrid approach, where you use both Active Record and raw SQL when necessary, can offer the best of both worlds.

For large scale applications, it is generally recommended to use Active Record. Active Record provides a number of features that can be helpful in developing and maintaining large scale applications, such as:

* **Associations:** Active Record allows you to easily define associations between models. This makes it easy to write code to retrieve and manipulate related data.
* **Validations:** Active Record allows you to define validations on your models. This helps to ensure that the data in your database is accurate and consistent.
* **Migrations:** Active Record provides a migration system that allows you to change your database schema over time. This is essential for large scale applications, which often need to have their database schema changed as new features are added.

While it is possible to use raw SQL in large scale applications, it is generally not recommended. Raw SQL can be difficult to write and maintain, and it is more susceptible to SQL injection attacks.

Here are some additional thoughts on using Active Record in large scale applications:

* When using Active Record in large scale applications, it is important to pay attention to performance. Active Record can sometimes be slower than raw SQL for certain operations. However, there are a number of things you can do to improve the performance of your Active Record code, such as using caching and eager loading.
* It is also important to use Active Record in a way that is consistent with your application's architecture. For example, if you are using a microservices architecture, you may want to use a separate database for each microservice. In this case, you would need to use Active Record in a way that allows you to connect to multiple databases.

Overall, Active Record is a good choice for developing and maintaining large scale applications. It provides a number of features that can be helpful in writing and maintaining database code, and it is less susceptible to SQL injection attacks than raw SQL.
