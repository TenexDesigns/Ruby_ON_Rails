Active Record is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework provided by Ruby on Rails.
It facilitates the interaction between the applications models and the database,
allowing you to manipulate and query data using object-oriented syntax. 
Heres an explanation of Active Record in Rails, its relationship to the ORM and models, and how to use it with code samples:

Active Record and ORM:
Active Record is an implementation of the ORM pattern, which maps database tables to Ruby objects and provides an 
abstraction layer for database operations. It allows you to work with data in the database using Ruby classes 
and methods instead of writing raw SQL queries.

Active Record and Models:
In Rails, models represent the applications data and encapsulate the business logic. 
Each model class inherits from ActiveRecord::Base, which provides a range of functionalities 
    for interacting with the database.

Example model (app/models/student.rb):

ruby
Copy code
class Student < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates :name, presence: true
  validates :email, presence: true, uniqueness: true
end
In the above example, the Student model inherits from ActiveRecord::Base. 
    It defines validations for the name and email attributes, ensuring that they are present and unique.

Using Active Record:
Active Record provides various methods to interact with the database, such as creating, reading, updating, 
and deleting records. Here are some commonly used methods:

Creating a record:

student = Student.new(name: 'John Doe', email: 'john@example.com')
student.save
Querying records:


students = Student.where(name: 'John Doe')
Updating a record:


student = Student.find(1)
student.name = 'Jane Doe'
student.save
Deleting a record:

student = Student.find(1)
student.destroy
These are just a few examples of the CRUD operations supported by Active Record.
It provides many other methods for querying, associations, validations, and more.

Relationships and Associations:
Active Record also enables defining relationships between models using associations such as has_many, 
belongs_to, and has_many :through. These associations simplify querying and manipulating related data.

Example model with association:


class Course < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :enrollments
  has_many :students, through: :enrollments
end
In the above example, the Course model has a many-to-many relationship with the Student model through the Enrollment model.
This allows easy access to students enrolled in a course.

Overall, Active Record simplifies database interactions by abstracting away the complexities of SQL queries and provides
a more intuitive object-oriented approach. It helps in structuring and managing data in Rails applications, 
making it easier to work with databases.

Active Record is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework included with Ruby on Rails that 
provides an interface and binding between the tables in a relational database and the Ruby
program code that manipulates database records. It closely follows the standard ORM model
and allows simple designs and straightforward mappings between database tables and application objects. [5]

In Rails, Active Record fits into the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm as the Model component.
The Model represents the data and business logic of the application, and Active Record provides a 
way to interact with the database and perform operations on the data. 
The Model is usually defined in the app/models directory and inherits from ActiveRecord::Base. [0]

Here are some key features of Active Record and how to use them:

CRUD Operations: Active Record provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations 
  
  for manipulating data in the database. You can use the create, find, update, and destroy methods
  to perform these operations. For example, to create a new record in the database, you can use the following code:
  product = Product.create(name: 'Widget', price: 10.99)
Associations: Active Record provides a way to define associations between models, 
  such as one-to-many and many-to-many relationships. You can use the belongs_to,
  has_one, has_many, and has_and_belongs_to_many methods to define these associations. 
  For example, to define a one-to-many association between a Product and Order model, you can use the following code:
    
  class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :orders
  end

  class Order < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :product
  end
Validations: Active Record provides a way to define validations for model attributes,
  ensuring that data is valid before its saved to the database. You can use the validates method to define validations.
  For example, to ensure that a Product has a name and price before its saved to the database, you can use the following code:
  class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
    validates :name, presence: true
    validates :price, presence: true
  end
Callbacks: Active Record provides hooks into the object life cycle,
  allowing you to trigger logic before or after an alteration of an objects state.
  You can use the before_save, after_save, and other methods to define callbacks. 
  For example, to update the updated_at attribute of a Product model before its 
  saved to the database, you can use the following code:
  class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
    before_save :update_timestamp

    def update_timestamp
      self.updated_at = Time.now
    end
  end
In summary, Active Record is an ORM framework included with Ruby on Rails that provides an 
interface and binding between the tables in a relational database and the Ruby program code 
that manipulates database records. Its closely related to the Model component in the MVC paradigm,
and provides a way to interact with the database and perform operations on the data.
Active Record provides CRUD operations, associations, validations, and callbacks,
making it a powerful tool for building database-backed applications.
