Active Record Query Interface in Rails provides a set of methods for querying the database and retrieving records. 
It allows you to interact with the database using Ruby code, instead of writing raw SQL.
Here are some examples of how to use Active Record Query Interface in Rails:

In Ruby on Rails, ActiveRecord provides a powerful query interface for interacting with the database.
It allows you to construct complex queries using a chainable DSL (Domain-Specific Language) 
and perform operations like retrieving records, filtering data, joining tables, and more.
Here are some examples of ActiveRecord queries in Rails:


Retrieving all records:

books = Book.all
This retrieves all records from the books table and assigns them to the books variable.




Retrieving a single record by ID:

book = Book.find(1)
This retrieves the record with an ID of 1 from the books table and assigns it to the book variable.





Retrieving records based on a condition:
books = Book.where(out_of_print: true)
This retrieves all records from the books table where the out_of_print attribute is true and assigns them to the books variable.




Retrieving records based on a join:

books = Book.joins(:author).where(authors: { name: 'J.K. Rowling' })

This retrieves all records from the books table that have an author with the name 'J.K. Rowling' and assigns them 
to the books variable.





Retrieving a limited number of records:
books = Book.limit(10)
This retrieves the first 10 records from the books table and assigns them to the books variable.



Retrieving records in a specific order:
books = Book.order(year_published: :desc)
This retrieves all records from the books table and orders them by the year_published attribute in descending order, 
and assigns them to the books variable.



Retrieving a subset of attributes:
books = Book.select(:title, :author_id)

This retrieves all records from the books table, but only includes the title and author_id attributes,
and assigns them to the books variable.



Basic Query:

users = User.all
This retrieves all records from the User table and assigns them to the users variable.





Conditions:

users = User.where(age: 18)
This retrieves all users where the age is 18.




Chaining Conditions:

users = User.where(age: 18).where(active: true)
This retrieves users where the age is 18 and the active attribute is true.





Ordering Results:

users = User.order(name: :asc)
This retrieves users ordered by the name attribute in ascending order.





Limit and Offset:

users = User.limit(10).offset(5)
This retrieves 10 users starting from the 6th record.





Joins:

users = User.joins(:posts)
This retrieves users who have associated posts.






Eager Loading Associations:

users = User.includes(:posts)
This retrieves users and eagerly loads their associated posts to avoid the N+1 query problem.





Aggregations:

average_age = User.average(:age)
This calculates the average age of users.





Grouping and Counting:

users_by_age = User.group(:age).count
This groups users by age and returns the count for each age.





Custom SQL Queries:

users = User.find_by_sql('SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 18')
This executes a custom SQL query and retrieves the matching records.







These are just a few examples of the many ActiveRecord query methods available in Rails. 
The ActiveRecord query interface allows you to build complex queries using a simple and expressive syntax,
making it easier to interact with your database and retrieve the data you need.


In summary, Active Record Query Interface in Rails provides a set of methods for querying the database and retrieving records.
It allows you to interact with the database using Ruby code, instead of writing raw SQL. There are several methods for 
retrieving records based on conditions, joins, limiting the number of records, and ordering the results.
The methods in the Book model have access to the fields in the Book table and can manipulate the data returned by the queries.
