The styling of an email sent through SendGrid (or any other email service provider) in a Rails GraphQL application is typically done through HTML and inline CSS styles. You can design and style your email templates just like you would with regular HTML templates. Here's how you can style an email in Rails:

1. **Create an HTML Email Template:**

   You can create an HTML email template in your Rails application using `.erb` files just like you do for regular views. In your mailer class (e.g., `UserMailer`), define the content of your email using HTML and include inline CSS styles where needed.

   For example, in your `app/views/user_mailer/welcome_email.html.erb` file:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
     <style>
       /* Inline CSS styles for your email */
       body {
         font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
         background-color: #f0f0f0;
         text-align: center;
       }
       .container {
         background-color: #ffffff;
         border: 1px solid #ddd;
         border-radius: 5px;
         padding: 20px;
         margin: 20px auto;
         max-width: 600px;
       }
       .header {
         background-color: #007bff;
         color: #fff;
         padding: 10px;
         border-radius: 5px 5px 0 0;
       }
     </style>
   </head>
   <body>
     <div class="container">
       <div class="header">
         <h1>Welcome to My App</h1>
       </div>
       <p>Hello, <%= @user.name %>,</p>
       <p>Thank you for joining My App. We're excited to have you as a member.</p>
     </div>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

2. **Use Variables for Personalization:**

   In the HTML template, you can use Ruby variables to personalize the email content. In the example above, `@user.name` is used to display the user's name in the email.

3. **Testing and Rendering:**

   To render the email template, you can call it from your mailer method. For example, in the `UserMailer` class:

   ```ruby
   def welcome_email(user)
     @user = user
     mail(to: @user.email, subject: 'Welcome to My App')
   end
   ```

4. **Testing and Previews:**

   It's important to preview and test your email templates before sending them. Rails provides tools like "email previews" to view your email templates in a browser for testing. You can access the email previews at `/rails/mailers` in your development environment.

5. **Testing in Email Clients:**

   It's also a good practice to test your email templates in various email clients (e.g., Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail) to ensure they look consistent and well-styled across different platforms. Email client rendering can sometimes vary, so testing helps ensure a good user experience.

Remember that email clients have varying support for CSS, so it's a best practice to use inline CSS styles instead of external stylesheets for consistent rendering. Additionally, avoid complex CSS or JavaScript in email templates as not all email clients support advanced features.

The example provided is a simple email template with minimal styling. You can enhance and customize the styling to match your application's branding and design requirements.
