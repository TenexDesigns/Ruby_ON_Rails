To style an email in Rails using SendGrid, you can use HTML and CSS. You can either create your own email templates or use a third-party email template service.

Once you have created your email templates, you can add them to SendGrid using the SendGrid API. Once your templates are uploaded to SendGrid, you can send emails using the SendGrid API and specify the template that you want to use.

Here is a code sample for sending an email using the SendGrid API and specifying a template:

```ruby
sendgrid = SendGrid.new(api_key: ENV['SENDGRID_API_KEY'])

message = SendGrid::Mail.new do |m|
  m.from = 'sender@example.com'
  m.to = 'recipient@example.com'
  m.subject = 'Test email'
  m.template_id = 'YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID'
end

sendgrid.send(message)
```

If you are using Action Mailer to send emails, you can also use the `sendgrid_template_id` option to specify the SendGrid template that you want to use.

Here is a code sample for sending an email using Action Mailer and specifying a SendGrid template:

```ruby
class UserMailer < ApplicationMailer
  default from: 'sender@example.com'

  def welcome_email(user)
    @user = user
    mail(to: user.email, subject: 'Welcome to our app!')
  end
end
```

```ruby
user = User.new(email: 'recipient@example.com')

UserMailer.welcome_email(user).sendgrid_template_id = 'YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID'
UserMailer.welcome_email(user).deliver_now
```

Once you have sent an email using SendGrid, the email will be styled according to the HTML and CSS in the template.

Here are some tips for styling emails in Rails:

* Use a CSS framework, such as Bootstrap or Foundation, to make it easier to style your emails.
* Use inline CSS to ensure that your styles are applied correctly.
* Use tables to layout your emails.
* Use images to make your emails more visually appealing.
* Test your emails in different email clients to ensure that they look good everywhere.
