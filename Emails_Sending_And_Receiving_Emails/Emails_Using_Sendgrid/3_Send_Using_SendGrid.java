Sure. Using a third-party email service provider like SendGrid is a popular approach to sending emails from Rails applications. It offers a number of advantages over using your own SMTP server, including:

* Reliability: SendGrid has a global network of servers and a track record of high deliverability rates.
* Scalability: SendGrid can easily handle large volumes of email traffic.
* Features: SendGrid offers a number of features that can be useful for Rails developers, such as email tracking, spam filtering, and email templates.

To implement SendGrid in a Rails GraphQL app, you will need to:

1. Create a SendGrid account and obtain an API key.
2. Install the SendGrid Ruby gem.
3. Configure your Rails application to use SendGrid.

Here is a code sample for configuring Rails to use SendGrid:

```ruby
config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :sendgrid
config.action_mailer.sendgrid_settings = {
  api_key: ENV['SENDGRID_API_KEY']
}
```

Once you have configured SendGrid, you can send emails from your Rails GraphQL app using the Action Mailer API.

To receive emails in a Rails GraphQL app, you can use the Action Mailbox gem. Action Mailbox provides a number of features for receiving and processing emails, including:

* Email routing: Action Mailbox can route incoming emails to different handlers based on their content.
* Email parsing: Action Mailbox can parse incoming emails and extract useful information, such as the sender, recipient, subject, and body.
* Email processing: Action Mailbox can process incoming emails and perform actions, such as creating new records in your database or sending notifications to users.

Here is a code sample for receiving emails using Action Mailbox:

```ruby
class EmailHandler
  def process(email)
    # Extract the relevant information from the email
    sender = email.from
    recipient = email.to
    subject = email.subject
    body = email.body

    # Perform the desired action
    # For example, you could create a new record in your database
  end
end

ActionMailbox.register_inbound_email_handler(EmailHandler)
```

Once you have registered an email handler, Action Mailbox will automatically process all incoming emails and route them to the handler.

**Is SendGrid better than using your own SMTP server?**

Whether or not SendGrid is better than using your own SMTP server depends on your specific needs. If you are sending a small volume of emails and reliability is not a major concern, then using your own SMTP server may be a good option. However, if you are sending a large volume of emails or you need to ensure high deliverability rates, then SendGrid is a better choice.

**Is the way to receive emails still the same?**

Yes, the way to receive emails in Rails is still the same, whether you are using SendGrid or your own SMTP server. You can use the Action Mailbox gem to receive and process emails.

I hope this information is helpful.
