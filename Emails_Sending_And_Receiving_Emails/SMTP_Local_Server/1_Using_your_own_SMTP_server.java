To send and receive emails in a Rails GraphQL API, you can use the Action Mailer and Action Mailbox components of Ruby on Rails. Here are the steps to set up and configure email sending using Action Mailer, and then later I'll explain how to use Action Mailbox for receiving and processing emails:

1. Setting up Action Mailer for Email Sending:

   Action Mailer is a part of the Rails framework and allows you to send emails. You need to configure your Rails application to use an SMTP server to send emails. Here are the steps:

   a. Store Sensitive Information:
   To securely store sensitive information such as SMTP credentials, you can use Rails' credentials system. This ensures that sensitive data is encrypted and not stored in plain text.

   First, run the following command to open your credentials file for editing:
   ```bash
   rails credentials:edit
   ```

   Edit your credentials file to include your SMTP username and password. Save and close the file. The credentials file should look something like this:
   ```yaml
   smtp:
     user_name: "your_smtp_username"
     password: "your_smtp_password"
   ```

   b. Configure Action Mailer in Rails:
   Now, you can configure Action Mailer to use the SMTP settings you just stored in the credentials file. You can do this in your Rails environment-specific configuration files (e.g., `config/environments/development.rb` and `config/environments/production.rb`). Here's an example configuration for Gmail:

   In `config/environments/development.rb` (You should do the same for `production.rb` with appropriate settings):
   ```ruby
   Rails.application.configure do
     # Other configuration settings...

     # Action Mailer configuration for Gmail
     config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :smtp
     config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = {
       address: "smtp.gmail.com",
       port: 587,
       domain: "your_domain.com",  # Your domain name
       authentication: :plain,
       user_name: Rails.application.credentials.smtp[:user_name],
       password: Rails.application.credentials.smtp[:password],
     }

     # Default URL options for links in emails
     config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost:3000' } # Change this to your host URL
   end
   ```

   You need to adjust the settings according to your email provider's requirements.

2. Sending Emails using Action Mailer:

   You can create a mailer class to define the emails you want to send. Here's a basic example:

   Create a new mailer:
   ```bash
   rails generate mailer UserMailer
   ```

   In `app/mailers/user_mailer.rb`, define a method for sending emails:
   ```ruby
   class UserMailer < ApplicationMailer
     def welcome_email(user)
       @user = user
       mail(to: @user.email, subject: 'Welcome to My App')
     end
   end
   ```

   In this example, we're creating a `welcome_email` method in the `UserMailer` class. You can pass user-specific data to this method and use it in the email template.

   Create an email view: Create the corresponding email template in `app/views/user_mailer/welcome_email.html.erb` and `app/views/user_mailer/welcome_email.text.erb`.

   Now you can send emails from your GraphQL API using this mailer. For example, in your GraphQL mutation, you can call the `UserMailer.welcome_email(user).deliver_now` method to send a welcome email.

3. Setting up Action Mailbox for Email Receiving (Optional):

   Action Mailbox is used to receive and process incoming emails. To set up Action Mailbox, follow these steps:

   a. Install Action Mailbox:
   In your Rails application, run the following command to install and configure Action Mailbox:
   ```bash
   rails action_mailbox:install
   ```

   b. Configure Inbound Email Routing:
   You can define routes for processing incoming emails in the `config/routes/action_mailbox.rb` file.

   Here's an example of routing an email to a GraphQL mutation:

   ```ruby
   Rails.application.routes.draw do
     post "rails/action_mailbox/inbound_emails" => "action_mailbox/inbound_emails#create"

     # Route an email to a GraphQL mutation
     post "/graphql", to: "graphql#execute"
   end
   ```

   c. Create an Inbound Email Processing Class:
   Create a class that handles the processing of incoming emails. This class should inherit from `ActionMailbox::Base` and define a `process` method to handle the email content. In your `process` method, you can call GraphQL mutations or perform any other actions you need.

   Here's an example of an inbound email processing class:

   ```ruby
   class MyInboundEmail < ActionMailbox::Base
     def process
       # Extract information from the email and call GraphQL mutations or perform actions
     end
   end
   ```

   Action Mailbox will automatically call the `process` method when a new email is received.

4. Testing Email Sending and Receiving:
   To test sending and receiving emails, you can use tools like MailCatcher or Mailtrap to capture and view sent and received emails during development and testing.

That's a basic guide to setting up email sending and receiving in a Rails GraphQL API using Action Mailer and Action Mailbox. Remember to customize the configurations and code to fit your specific requirements and email service provider settings.
