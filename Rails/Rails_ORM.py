In Rails, the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework provided is called ActiveRecord.
ActiveRecord is an implementation of the ORM pattern, which allows you to interact with your database using Ruby objects,
rather than writing raw SQL queries. It provides a convenient and intuitive way to handle database operations and relationships.

Here are some key features and concepts of ActiveRecord in Rails:

Models: In Rails, models represent database tables and encapsulate business logic. E
  ach model class is a subclass of ActiveRecord::Base. Models define associations, validations, and query methods.
      They also provide an interface to interact with the underlying database table.

Associations: ActiveRecord provides associations to define relationships between models. 
  Some common associations include has_many, belongs_to, has_one, and has_and_belongs_to_many. 
  These associations help you establish relationships and navigate between related objects.

Migrations: Migrations are used to create and modify database schemas. ActiveRecord provides 
  a DSL (Domain-Specific Language) to define migrations, allowing you to create tables, add columns,
  define indexes, and perform other database schema modifications. Migrations ensure that your database 
  schema evolves alongside your application.

Query Interface: ActiveRecord provides a query interface to retrieve and manipulate data from the database. 
  It allows you to write expressive queries using methods like where, order, limit, joins, and more. 
  The query interface abstracts away the underlying SQL syntax and provides a Ruby-like API for querying the database.

Validations: ActiveRecord supports validations to ensure data integrity. You can define validations on model 
  attributes using built-in validation helpers such as presence, length, uniqueness, and more. 
  Validations help you enforce rules and constraints on the data being saved to the database.

Callbacks: Callbacks are hooks provided by ActiveRecord that allow you to trigger certain actions at specific 
  points in an objects lifecycle. You can use callbacks to perform actions before or after certain events,
  such as saving, updating, or deleting records.

Scopes: Scopes in ActiveRecord allow you to define reusable query conditions that can be applied to model queries.
  Scopes make it easy to define commonly used filters or conditions and chain them together to create more complex queries.

These are just some of the features and concepts provided by ActiveRecord in Rails. It simplifies database interactions,
reduces the need for writing raw SQL queries, and promotes a more object-oriented approach to working with databases 
in your Rails applications.

Active Record is the Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) included in the Ruby on Rails framework.
It provides a simple and elegant way to interact with your database.

Active Record models are classes that represent database tables. Each model has a corresponding table in the database,
and each instance of the model represents a row in the table.

To create a new model, you use the ActiveRecord::Base class. For example, to create a model for a Post table, 
    you would use the following code:

Ruby
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
end
Use code with caution. Learn more
Once you have created a model, you can use it to interact with the database. 
For example, to get all of the posts from the database, you would use the following code:

Ruby
Post.all
Use code with caution. Learn more
This will return an array of all of the Post objects in the database.

You can also use Active Record to create, update, and delete records in the database.
For example, to create a new post, you would use the following code:

Ruby
post = Post.new(title: "My First Post", body: "This is my first post.")
post.save
Use code with caution. Learn more
This will create a new Post object with the given title and body, and save it to the database.

Active Record is a powerful tool that can make it easy to interact with your database. 
By using Active Record, you can focus on your application logic and let Active Record take care of the database access.

Here are some of the benefits of using Active Record:

Simple and elegant syntax. Active Record provides a simple and elegant syntax for interacting with your database.
Powerful features. Active Record provides a wide range of features for interacting with your database, including CRUD operations,
validations, and relationships.

Efficient performance. Active Record is designed to be efficient, so you can be sure that your application will perform well.
If you are using Ruby on Rails, then you should definitely use Active Record to interact with your database. 
It will make your life much easier and your application will be more efficient.

Rails ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) refers to the Active Record library, which is a crucial part of the Rails framework.
Active Record provides an abstraction layer over the database, 
allowing developers to interact with the database using Ruby objects and methods instead of writing raw SQL queries.
This makes it easier to write and maintain code, as developers can work with Ruby objects and methods rather than SQL statements.

Active Record follows the convention over configuration principle, which means that by following Rails conventions, 
youll need very little explicit configuration when creating Active Record models. This results in less boilerplate code and
a more streamlined development process.

One of the advantages of using Rails ORM is its flexibility. While Active Record is the default ORM for Rails applications,
it is possible to use other ORMs or even raw SQL queries when necessary. 
For example, if you need to perform complex queries that are not easily achievable using Active Record,
you can use Arel or raw SQL to achieve the desired functionality.

Rails ORM also supports various database systems, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite.
To work with multiple databases or different types of ORMs, you can configure your database.yml file accordingly 
and specify the appropriate adapter and connection settings.

In summary, Rails ORM (Active Record) provides a powerful and flexible way to interact with databases in Rails applications, 
allowing developers to write clean and maintainable code while minimizing boilerplate and configuration.
