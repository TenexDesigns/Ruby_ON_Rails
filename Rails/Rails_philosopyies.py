The Rails philosophy, often referred to as "Convention over Configuration," emphasizes following established
conventions and leveraging defaults to simplify and speed up web application development. 
Here are some key principles of the Rails philosophy, explained with code samples:

DRY (Dont Repeat Yourself):
The Rails framework encourages avoiding duplication of code by promoting reusable components and following 
     the "DRY" principle. For example, Rails provides built-in helper methods that can be used across views to avoid repeating code.

# app/views/users/show.html.erb
<%= render 'shared/user_info', user: @user %>

# app/views/shared/_user_info.html.erb
<h1><%= user.name %></h1>
<p><%= user.email %></p>
     
     
     
     
Convention over Configuration:
  
Rails makes assumptions about how things should work, reducing the need for manual configuration. 
By following naming conventions, Rails can automatically map URLs to controller actions and database tables to model classes.

# config/routes.rb
resources :articles

# app/controllers/articles_controller.rb
class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @articles = Article.all
  end

  def show
    @article = Article.find(params[:id])
  end

  # ...
end






RESTful Design:
  
Rails encourages designing web applications around RESTful principles, which map HTTP verbs to controller actions. 
This promotes a standardized way of handling CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

# config/routes.rb
resources :articles

# app/controllers/articles_controller.rb
class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
  def index
    # Fetch all articles
  end

  def show
    # Fetch a specific article
  end

  def create
    # Create a new article
  end

  def update
    # Update an existing article
  end

  def destroy
    # Delete an article
  end
end






Convention for Database Schema:
  
Rails uses a migration system to manage database schema changes. 
Migrations allow you to define database tables and modify their structure using Ruby code, 
which can be version-controlled and easily shared among team members.

# db/migrate/20220101000000_create_articles.rb
class CreateArticles < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.1]
  def change
    create_table :articles do |t|
      t.string :title
      t.text :content
      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end






Testing and Test-Driven Development (TDD):
  
Rails promotes writing automated tests to ensure application stability and maintainability. 
The framework includes testing frameworks like Minitest and RSpec, making it easier to write unit tests,
integration tests, and functional tests.

# test/models/article_test.rb
require 'test_helper'

class ArticleTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  test "should save valid article" do
    article = Article.new(title: "Test", content: "Lorem ipsum")
    assert article.save
  end

  test "should not save article without title" do
    article = Article.new(content: "Lorem ipsum")
    assert_not article.save
  end
end




These examples highlight some of the core principles of the Rails philosophy. 
By following conventions and leveraging the built-in functionality of the framework,
Rails aims to reduce the time and effort required for web application development, 
while maintaining code clarity and best practices.

The Rails philosophy is centered around the idea of convention over configuration. 
This means that Rails provides a set of conventions for organizing code and configuring the application,
which leads to less boilerplate code and a more efficient development process. By following these conventions, 
developers can focus on writing the unique parts of their applications rather than spending time configuring 
the framework link.springer.com.

Here are some code samples that demonstrate the Rails philosophy:

Naming conventions: Rails follows strict naming conventions for files, folders, and database tables.
app/
  controllers/
    users_controller.rb
  models/
    user.rb
  views/
    users/
      new.html.erb
      edit.html.erb
      index.html.erb
RESTful routing: Rails uses RESTful conventions for organizing routes and controllers.
# config/routes.rb
resources :users
# app/controllers/users_controller.rb
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def new
    @user = User.new
  end

  def create
    @user = User.new(user_params)
    if @user.save
      redirect_to users_path
    else
      render :new
    end
  end

  private

  def user_params
    params.require(:user).permit(:name, :email)
  end
end
ActiveRecord ORM: Rails uses ActiveRecord as its ORM, which simplifies database interactions by abstracting them behind objects.
# app/models/user.rb
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates :name, presence: true
  validates :email, uniqueness: true
end
# app/controllers/users_controller.rb
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def create
    @user = User.new(user_params)
    if @user.save
      redirect_to users_path
    else
      render :new
    end
  end

  private

  def user_params
    params.require(:user).permit(:name, :email)
  end
end
These code samples demonstrate how Rails follows conventions 
and simplifies the development process, allowing developers to focus on writing the unique parts of their applications

Sure. Rails philosophy is based on the following principles:

Convention over configuration: Rails uses convention over configuration to make development 
  more rapid and less error-prone. This means that Rails developers typically do not need to 
  write a lot of configuration files. Instead, Rails uses conventions to determine how applications should be structured.
DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): Rails follows the DRY principle to make code more maintainable. 
     This means that code should be written in a way that it does not need to be repeated. 
     
     
     Rails uses a variety of techniques to achieve this, such as helper methods and partials.
Model-View-Controller (MVC): Rails uses the MVC pattern to structure applications.
     This pattern divides applications into three parts: models, views, and controllers.
     Models represent data, views display data, and controllers handle user input.
RESTful routing: Rails uses RESTful routing to map URLs to controller actions. 
     This makes applications more scalable and easier to maintain.
     
     
Test-driven development (TDD): Rails encourages the use of TDD to improve the quality of applications.
     TDD is a software development process that involves writing tests before writing code. 
     This helps to ensure that code is correct and that it meets the requirements of the application.
Here are some code samples that illustrate how Rails philosophy can be used to write better code:

Ruby
# This code uses convention over configuration to create a new user
user = User.new

# This code uses DRY to avoid repeating code
def render_partial(partial_name)
  render partial: partial_name
end

# This code uses the MVC pattern to create a new blog post
post = Post.new
post.title = "My first blog post"
post.body = "This is my first blog post."
post.save

# This code uses RESTful routing to map the URL `/posts` to the controller action `index`
get '/posts', to: 'posts#index'

# This code uses TDD to write a test for the `index` controller action
test "should get the index page" do
  get '/posts'
  assert_response :success
  assert_template :index
end
