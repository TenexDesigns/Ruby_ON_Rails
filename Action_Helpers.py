Action helpers in Rails are methods provided by the framework to simplify common tasks and generate HTML tags for various elements. 
They are designed to assist in generating URLs, forms, links, and other interactive elements in your views.
Let's explore some commonly used action helpers in Rails:

link_to: The link_to helper generates a hyperlink. 
  It takes the text to display as the first argument and the URL or route helper as the second argument.
  Here's an example:


<%= link_to 'Go to Home', root_path %>

This will generate an HTML hyperlink with the text "Go to Home" that links to the root path of your application.

form_for: The form_for helper generates a form for a specific model object.
  It takes the model object as an argument and a block containing the form fields. Here's an example:


<%= form_for @user do |f| %>
  <%= f.label :name %>
  <%= f.text_field :name %>

  <%= f.submit 'Save' %>
<% end %>

This will generate an HTML form for the @user object with a text field for the name attribute and a submit button.

image_tag: The image_tag helper generates an HTML <img> tag for displaying an image.
  It takes the image source as the first argument and optional options such as alt and class. Here's an example:


<%= image_tag 'logo.png', alt: 'Logo', class: 'logo-image' %>
This will generate an HTML <img> tag with the source pointing to the "logo.png" image file and alt text set to "Logo".
It can also apply a CSS class to the image.

button_to: The button_to helper generates a button that submits a form when clicked.
  It takes the button label as the first argument and the URL or route helper as the second argument. Here's an example:


<%= button_to 'Delete', user_path(@user), method: :delete %>
This will generate an HTML button with the label "Delete" that, when clicked,
sends a DELETE request to the user_path route for the @user object.

content_tag: The content_tag helper generates custom HTML tags with specified content and attributes.
  It takes the tag name as the first argument, the content as the second argument, and optional attributes as a hash.
  Heres an example:


<%= content_tag :div, 'Hello, World!', class: 'greeting' %>
This will generate an HTML <div> tag with the content "Hello, World!" and the CSS class "greeting".

These are just a few examples of the action helpers available in Rails.
They provide convenient methods to generate HTML elements and simplify common tasks in your views.
By using action helpers, you can write cleaner and more maintainable view templates.










MORE EXPLANATION
*****************************************************************************************************


Action helpers in Rails are a set of methods that provide convenient ways to generate HTML and other content in views. 
They are part of the Action View library and are used to generate form elements, links, and other HTML content.
Some common examples of action helpers include link_to, button_to, form_tag, and form_for [2] [8].

Action helpers are available in views by default. However, if you want to use them in controllers,
you need to include the ActionController::Helpers module.
    This module provides a set of helper methods that can be used in controllers and views. 
    When you include this module in your controller, all the helpers are available in that controller [0].
