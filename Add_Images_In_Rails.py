To add images to a Rails application, you can follow these steps:

Place the image files in the appropriate directory: In a standard Rails application, 
  images are typically stored in the app/assets/images directory.
  Create this directory if it doesnt exist already. You can organize your images into subdirectories within 
  the images folder if desired.
  

Use the image_tag helper in your views: In your view files (e.g., .html.erb or .haml),
  you can use the image_tag helper to generate the HTML <img> tag for your image. 
  The image_tag helper takes the path to the image as an argument and returns the appropriate HTML code. For example:


<%= image_tag('path/to/your/image.jpg') %>
You can use a relative path from the app/assets/images directory or an absolute path if the
image is located outside that directory.

Precompile assets (if necessary): By default, Rails automatically serves static assets
  from the public/assets directory in production for better performance. However, during development,
  Rails will serve assets dynamically. If you want to precompile your assets (including images) for production,
  you can run the following command in your terminal:


rails assets:precompile
This command will generate the compiled assets and place them in the public/assets directory.

Verify your image is being served correctly: Start your Rails server (rails server) and navigate to the corresponding 
  view in your web browser. Inspect the HTML source code to ensure that the image_tag helper has generated
  the correct <img> tag with the proper source.

Thats it! You should now be able to add images to your Rails application using the image_tag helper. 
Remember to handle image uploading and processing separately if youre dealing with user-uploaded images.

There are a few ways to add images to Rails.

Using the asset pipeline

The asset pipeline is a Rails feature that allows you to compile and serve assets, 
such as images, CSS, and JavaScript, in a single request. To add an image to the asset pipeline,
you first need to create a folder in your Rails project called app/assets/images.
Then, you can copy your image files into this folder.

Once your images are in the app/assets/images folder, you can reference them in your Rails views using
the image_tag helper. For example, the following code will display an image called image.png in your view:

Code snippet
<%= image_tag "image.png" %>
Use code with caution. Learn more
Using Active Storage

Active Storage is a new Rails feature that provides a more flexible and scalable way to store and serve files,
including images. To use Active Storage, you first need to add the active_storage gem to your Rails project.
You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

Code snippet
bundle add active_storage
Use code with caution. Learn more
Once you have added the active_storage gem, you can create an image attachment for a model by using the
has_one_attached or has_many_attached macro. For example, the following code will create an image attachment for the User model:

Code snippet
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_one_attached :avatar
end
Use code with caution. Learn more
Once you have created an image attachment for a model, you can upload an image to the attachment using 

the attach_file method. For example, the following code will upload an image called image.png to the avatar
attachment for the current user:

Code snippet
current_user.avatar.attach(io: File.open("image.png"), filename: "image.png")
Use code with caution. Learn more
Once you have uploaded an image to an attachment, you can access the image in your Rails views using the image_tag helper.
For example, the following code will display the image that is attached to the avatar attachment for the current user:

Code snippet
<%= image_tag current_user.avatar %>
Use code with caution. Learn more
Which method should I use?

The best method for adding images to Rails depends on your specific needs. If you are only storing a few images,
and you dont need to do anything fancy with them, then using the asset pipeline is probably 
the easiest option. However, if you need to store a lot of images, or if you need to do things like resize or
crop images, then using Active Storage is a better option
