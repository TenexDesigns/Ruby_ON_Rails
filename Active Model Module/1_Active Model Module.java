What is the Active Model module in Rails?

The Active Model module in Rails provides a set of features that can be used to add functionality to plain old Ruby objects (POROs). These features include:

Model attributes
Validations
Callbacks
Serialization
Integration with the Rails internationalization (i18n) framework
Where and how is the Active Model module used in Rails?

The Active Model module can be used in a variety of places in Rails applications, including:

Model classes
Service objects
View models
Form objects
Test objects




  The Active Model module in Ruby on Rails provides a set of features that allow plain old Ruby objects (POROs) to gain some of the capabilities typically associated with Active Record models, without the need for persistence or a database.

Here's an example to illustrate the usage and benefits of Active Model:

```ruby
require 'active_model'

class Person
  include ActiveModel::Model

  attr_accessor :name, :age

  validates_presence_of :name
  validates_numericality_of :age, greater_than: 0
end
```

In this example, we define a `Person` class and include `ActiveModel::Model` to gain the features provided by Active Model.

By including `ActiveModel::Model`, the `Person` class gains the following capabilities:

1. Attribute handling: The `attr_accessor` method is used to define `name` and `age` attributes. This allows us to read and write these attributes on instances of the `Person` class.

2. Validations: We use the `validates_presence_of` and `validates_numericality_of` methods to define validations for the `name` and `age` attributes, respectively. These validations ensure that the `name` attribute is present and that the `age` attribute is a positive number.

With Active Model, we can now create instances of the `Person` class, validate their attributes, and perform other operations typically associated with Active Record models:

```ruby
person = Person.new(name: "John", age: 25)
person.valid? # true

person.name = nil
person.valid? # false
person.errors.full_messages # ["Name can't be blank"]

person.age = -5
person.valid? # false
person.errors.full_messages # ["Age must be greater than 0"]
```

In this example, we create a `Person` instance with valid attributes and check its validity using the `valid?` method. We then modify the attributes to make them invalid and check the validation errors using the `errors.full_messages` method.

Active Model is commonly used in Rails applications when you need to work with data objects that don't require persistence or a database. It allows you to leverage features like attribute handling, validations, and more, without the overhead of an Active Record model.

                                                         Active Model is a module in Ruby on Rails that provides a way to create Ruby classes (often referred to as Plain Old Ruby Objects or POROs) that behave like ActiveRecord models without the need for database persistence. It allows you to include features like attribute accessors, validations, and more in your classes, making them compatible with Rails' form helpers, controllers, and other parts of the framework. This can be useful when you need to work with data structures that don't map to database tables but still want to leverage Rails' functionality.

Here's how you can use the Active Model module in Rails with code samples:

**Step 1: Include ActiveModel::Model**

First, include the `ActiveModel::Model` module in your class definition. This gives your class the behavior of an Active Model.

```ruby
class MyModel
  include ActiveModel::Model
end
```

**Step 2: Define Attributes**

You can define attributes with accessors in your class, just like you would with ActiveRecord models. For example, if you have a `User` class:

```ruby
class User
  include ActiveModel::Model
  attr_accessor :username, :email
end
```

**Step 3: Use the Class**

Now, you can use your class as if it were an ActiveRecord model:

```ruby
# Create an instance of your class
user = User.new(username: 'john_doe', email: 'john@example.com')

# Access attributes
puts user.username
puts user.email

# Perform validations (Active Model validations)
user.valid?  # This will run validations if defined

# You can use form helpers in your views
# (e.g., in a Rails form for user input)
```

**Step 4: Define Validations**

You can use Active Model validations to add data validation rules to your class. For example:

```ruby
class User
  include ActiveModel::Model
  attr_accessor :username, :email

  validates :username, presence: true
  validates :email, format: { with: URI::MailTo::EMAIL_REGEXP }
end
```

In this example, we've added validations to ensure the presence of a username and validate that the email follows a specific format.

By including Active Model, you can make your PORO work seamlessly with Rails, making it easier to integrate them into your application, especially when dealing with forms, controllers, and views. It's a powerful way to leverage Rails functionality without the need for a database-backed model.
