In Ruby on Rails, there is a convention for structuring your application that encourages separation of concerns and follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. This convention makes it clear where different types of logic should be placed. Here's how you typically organize business logic in Rails:

1. **Models**:
   - Models represent your data and the business logic associated with that data. They are responsible for encapsulating data manipulation and interactions with the database. Business logic related to data validation, associations, and custom methods should be placed in your models.
   - Models are typically located in the `app/models` directory.

   Example model with business logic:

   ```ruby
   class User < ApplicationRecord
     validates_presence_of :name
     has_many :posts

     def full_name
       "#{first_name} #{last_name}"
     end

     def can_edit_post?(post)
       # Custom logic to determine if a user can edit a post
     end
   ```

2. **Controllers**:
   - Controllers handle the flow of the application, receive incoming requests, and route them to the appropriate actions. Controllers should be responsible for handling the HTTP-specific aspects of your application, such as user input and rendering views.
   - Controllers are typically located in the `app/controllers` directory.

   Example controller with request-handling logic:

   ```ruby
   class UsersController < ApplicationController
     def show
       @user = User.find(params[:id])
     end

     def edit
       @user = User.find(params[:id])
     end

     def update
       @user = User.find(params[:id])
       if @user.update(user_params)
         redirect_to user_path(@user)
       else
         render 'edit'
       end
     end
   ```

3. **Services**:
   - In Rails, you can create service objects to encapsulate complex business logic that doesn't fit neatly into models or controllers. Service objects are plain Ruby classes designed to perform specific tasks.
   - Service objects are usually located in a separate directory under `app/services` or `app/services/concerns`.

   Example service object:

   ```ruby
   class PaymentService
     def process_payment(order)
       # Custom payment processing logic
     end
   ```

4. **Libraries**:
   - For more generic and reusable business logic that doesn't fit into models, controllers, or services, you can create custom Ruby libraries and place them in the `lib` directory.
   - The `lib` directory allows you to structure your code outside of the conventional Rails framework, making it suitable for standalone libraries and modules.

5. **Callbacks**:
   - As discussed earlier, Rails models support callbacks for handling lifecycle events. You can place model-specific business logic within these callbacks.

In summary, Rails encourages a clear separation of concerns. Models handle data-related logic, controllers handle request/response logic, services handle complex business logic, libraries provide reusable functionality, and callbacks can be used for model-specific logic. Following these conventions helps keep your Rails application organized and maintainable.
