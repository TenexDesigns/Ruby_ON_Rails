To make calls to a GraphQL API from the front-end, you can use a GraphQL client library such as Apollo Client.

Apollo Client
Apollo Client is a popular GraphQL client library that is available for both web and mobile applications. It provides a number of features that make it easy to consume GraphQL APIs, such as:

Automatic caching of query results
Support for batching and preloading
Error handling
Subscription support
To use Apollo Client, you will need to install the apollo-client package. You can then create a new Apollo Client instance and pass it the URL of your GraphQL API.

Once you have created an Apollo Client instance, you can use it to execute GraphQL queries and mutations. To execute a query, you can use the query method. To execute a mutation, you can use the mutate method.

For example, the following code shows how to use Apollo Client to execute the users query:

JavaScript
import { ApolloClient, gql } from '@apollo/client';

const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: 'http://localhost:3000/graphql',
});

const query = gql`
  query users {
    users {
      id
      name
      email
    }
  }
`;

client.query({ query })
  .then(response => {
    const users = response.data.users;

    // Do something with the users
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // Handle the error
  });

You can use a similar approach to execute mutations and subscriptions.

Consuming GraphQL data in Next.js
To consume GraphQL data in Next.js, you can use the useQuery and useMutation hooks. These hooks provide a simple way to execute GraphQL queries and mutations from your Next.js components.

For example, the following code shows how to use the useQuery hook to render the results of the users query:

JavaScript
import { useQuery } from '@apollo/client';

const Users = () => {
  const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(gql`
    query users {
      users {
        id
        name
        email
      }
    }
  `);

  if (loading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  if (error) {
    return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;
  }

  const users = data.users;

  return (
    <ul>
      {users.map(user => (
        <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};

export default Users;

You can use a similar approach to use the useMutation hook to execute mutations.

Consuming GraphQL data in Flutter
To consume GraphQL data in Flutter, you can use the graphql package. This package provides a simple way to execute GraphQL queries and mutations from your Flutter applications.

For example, the following code shows how to use the graphql package to execute the users query:

Dart
import 'package:graphql/client.dart';

Future<List<User>> getUsers() async {
  final client = GraphQLClient(
    uri: 'http://localhost:3000/graphql',
    cache: GraphQLCache(),
  );

  final query = gql('''
    query users {
      users {
        id
        name
        email
      }
    }
  ''');

  final result = await client.query(query);

  final users = result.data['users'] as List<dynamic>;

  return users.map((user) => User.fromJson(user)).toList();
}
Use code with caution. Learn more
You can use a similar approach to execute mutations.

Once you have fetched the GraphQL data, you can use it in your Flutter application like any other data. For example, you could display the data in a list or render it in a chart.

Conclusion
Consuming GraphQL data from the front-end is relatively simple. You can use a GraphQL client library such as Apollo Client to make the process even easier.
