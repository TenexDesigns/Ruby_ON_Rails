uninitialized constant Mutations::SignUpUser
------------------------------------------------------






The error message "uninitialized constant Mutations::SignUpUser" suggests that GraphQL cannot find the `Mutations::SignUpUser` class. This error usually occurs when there's an issue with how the class is defined or how your project is structured.

Here are some steps to troubleshoot and potentially resolve this issue:

1. **Class Name and File Location**: Make sure that your `SignUpUser` mutation class is defined correctly, and the file is in the expected location.

   - Confirm that the class name is spelled correctly as `SignUpUser` and it's located in the correct file, `sign_up_user.rb`.
   - The correct location should be in the `mutations` directory under the `app/graphql` folder.

   For example, the file structure should look like this:

   ```
   app/graphql/mutations/sign_up_user.rb
   ```

2. **File Autoloading**: Ensure that the `mutations` directory is included in Rails' autoloading paths. In a standard Rails project, this should work out of the box, but double-check to be sure.

   You can also try running:

   ```bash
   bin/spring stop
   ```

   This will restart Spring, which can sometimes be the cause of autoloading issues.

3. **Namespacing**: Verify that the `Mutations` module is properly defined in your mutation file. It should look like this:

   ```ruby
   module Mutations
     class SignUpUser < BaseMutation
     # ...
     end
   end
   ```

4. **GraphQL Schema**: Ensure that your mutation is correctly added to the GraphQL schema. The mutation type in `MutationType` should match the name of the mutation class.

   In your `mutation_type.rb`:

   ```ruby
   field :signUpUser, mutation: Mutations::SignUpUser
   ```

5. **Schema Regeneration**: Sometimes, issues with autoloading or caching can cause problems. Try regenerating your GraphQL schema:

   ```bash
   bin/rails graphql:schema:generate
   ```

6. **Restart the Rails Server**: After making changes, it's a good practice to restart your Rails server to ensure that all changes are loaded correctly.

7. **Namespace Issues**: Ensure that you don't have namespace conflicts or naming issues in your project that could prevent Rails from finding the correct classes.

8. **Typo or Syntax Error**: Check for any typos or syntax errors within your `sign_up_user.rb` file.

After making sure that all of these aspects are correct, try running your GraphQL mutation again. If you still encounter the error, please double-check the file and class names, and ensure that there are no typos or other issues that could be preventing the class from being loaded correctly.
