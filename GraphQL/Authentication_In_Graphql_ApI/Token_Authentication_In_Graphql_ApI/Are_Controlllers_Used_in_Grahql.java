In a GraphQL-based Rails application, you typically don't use the controllers provided by Devise or Devise Token Auth in the same way you would in a RESTful application. GraphQL abstracts away the need for dedicated controllers for specific actions because GraphQL queries and mutations handle the request and response data more flexibly. Here's how it works:

1. **GraphQL Mutations:** In a GraphQL API, you often define mutations for actions like user registration, sign-in, or other user-related operations. Mutations are the equivalent of custom controller actions in RESTful applications. Instead of defining actions in a controller, you define mutations in your GraphQL schema.

   For example, a user registration mutation might look like this:

   ```ruby
   module Types
     class MutationType < Types::BaseObject
       field :registerUser, mutation: Mutations::RegisterUser
     end
   end
   ```

2. **Custom Mutations:** You can create custom mutations in your Rails application that encapsulate the logic for user registration, sign-in, or other user-related actions. These custom mutations allow you to specify what data is expected, control validation, and perform the actions.

   For instance, you might create a `Mutations::RegisterUser` class that defines the behavior for user registration.

3. **Route Configuration:** In your routes configuration, you don't use Devise Token Auth controllers for GraphQL requests because GraphQL doesn't follow the same RESTful conventions. Instead, you route your GraphQL requests to a single endpoint, typically mapped to a controller action where the GraphQL engine handles the execution.

   For example, you might have a route like this for your GraphQL endpoint:

   ```ruby
   post "/graphql", to: "graphql#execute"
   ```

4. **Secure Endpoints:** The authentication and authorization in a GraphQL API can be different from traditional RESTful APIs. In GraphQL, you typically secure specific fields or parts of your schema, rather than securing endpoints like you do in REST. Authentication checks are often implemented as middleware or within the resolvers for specific fields or mutations.

   The `mount_devise_token_auth_for 'User', at: 'graphql'` line you've mentioned is related to token-based authentication, which is common in RESTful APIs. It may not be directly applicable to GraphQL. Instead, you may use token
