"In a GraphQL Rails API app, the controllers provided by Devise and Devise Token Auth are not used directly.
  Instead, you will primarily use mutations and resolvers to handle authentication and user management."









-------------------------------------------------------------------
To implement token-based authentication in a GraphQL Rails API app with Devise and Devise Token Auth, as well as apply custom validations to email and password, follow these steps:

**Step 1: Add Devise and Devise Token Auth to Your Gemfile**
Add the `devise` and `devise_token_auth` gems to your Rails application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'devise'
gem 'devise_token_auth'
```

Then, run `bundle install` to install the gems.

**Step 2: Set Up Devise and Devise Token Auth**

Run the Devise and Devise Token Auth install generators:

```bash
rails generate devise:install
rails generate devise_token_auth:install User auth
```

The above commands will create configuration files, migrations, and route setup for Devise and Devise Token Auth. The second command uses the `User` model and mounts the authentication routes at `/auth`.

**Step 3: Customize Your User Model**

Edit your `User` model (`app/models/user.rb`) to include custom validations and any additional fields. For example, to add a custom email validation:

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  # Include default Devise modules and any custom fields
  devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable, :validatable

  # Devise Token Auth modules
  include DeviseTokenAuth::Concerns::User

  # Custom validations
  validates :email, presence: true, uniqueness: true, format: { with: /\A[^@\s]+@example\.com\z/, message: "Email must be from example.com domain" }
end
```

**Step 4: Run Migrations**

Run the migrations to create the necessary database tables:

```bash
rails db:migrate
```

**Step 5: Define Custom Mutations for Registration and Sign-In**

Define custom mutations in your GraphQL schema to handle user registration and sign-in. In your GraphQL schema file (e.g., `app/graphql/types/mutation_type.rb`), add your custom mutations. You can use the `devise_token_auth` gem's controller methods in your mutations.

Here's an example of custom mutations for user registration and sign-in:

```ruby
module Types
  class MutationType < Types::BaseObject
    # Custom registration mutation
    field :register, mutation: Mutations::RegisterUser

    # Custom sign-in mutation
    field :signIn, mutation: Mutations::SignInUser
  end
end
```

**Step 6: Implement Custom Mutations and Resolvers**

Create custom mutations and resolvers for user registration and sign-in in your GraphQL app. You can use the Devise Token Auth gem's controller methods within your custom mutations.

Here's an example of a custom mutation for user registration (`app/graphql/mutations/register_user.rb`):

```ruby
module Mutations
  class RegisterUser < BaseMutation
    argument :email, String, required: true
    argument :password, String, required: true

    field :user, Types::UserType, null: true
    field :errors, [String], null: false

    def resolve(email:, password:)
      user = User.new(email: email, password: password)
      if user.save
        {
          user: user,
          errors: [],
        }
      else
        {
          user: nil,
          errors: user.errors.full_messages,
        }
      end
    end
  end
end
```

**Step 7: Configure Authentication Routes**

In your `config/routes.rb`, you may need to configure authentication routes to handle registration and sign-in via GraphQL. Here's an example of how to set up custom routes for these actions:

```ruby
mount_devise_token_auth_for 'User', at: 'graphql', controllers: {
  registrations: 'auth/registrations', # Replace with your custom registrations controller
  sessions: 'auth/sessions', # Replace with your custom sessions controller
}
```

**Step 8: Use Authentication in Your GraphQL API**

Now, you can use the API endpoints provided by `devise_token_auth` to allow users to sign up, sign in, and sign out. Here are some common API endpoints:

- Sign-up: POST to `/graphql/auth` with the user's email, password, and other required information.
- Sign-in: POST to `/graphql/auth/sign_in` with the user's email and password to obtain a token.
- Sign-out: DELETE to `/graphql/auth/sign_out` with the user's token to log the user out.

You can also use the endpoints for account confirmation, password reset, and other authentication-related actions as needed.

**Step 8: Secure Your GraphQL API**

Implement proper security measures, such as using HTTPS, handling token expiration, and handling token refresh, to enhance the security of your GraphQL API.

Regarding the use of namespacing and versioning, you can update the `mount_devise_token_auth_for` line as demonstrated above to accommodate your GraphQL structure and naming conventions. Make sure the endpoint paths align with your GraphQL schema and routes.


**Step 9.2: Secure Your GraphQL Mutations**

To secure your GraphQL mutations, you can implement authorization checks within your resolvers or custom mutations to ensure that only authenticated users can perform registration and sign-in actions.

**Step 9: Test Your Custom Mutations**

Test your custom mutations by using a GraphQL client like Postman, Insomnia, or a GraphQL client library. Verify that user registration and sign-in work as expected, and that custom validations are applied.

By following these steps, you can implement token-based authentication, custom validations, and user registration/sign-in in your GraphQL Rails API app using Devise and Devise Token Auth. This approach allows you to handle authentication and user management in a GraphQL-specific manner, bypassing the traditional Devise controller actions used in RESTful applications.
