To secure the endpoints for authentication in your GraphQL API, you need to add authentication checks to the relevant GraphQL mutations and queries in your schema. The `devise_token_auth` gem primarily takes care of authentication at the REST API level. However, with GraphQL, you have more control over which parts of your schema are protected by authentication.

Here's a general guideline on how to secure GraphQL endpoints in the context of your routes:

1. **Update the Routes**: You've already set up the routes to use `devise_token_auth` for authentication. The `mount_devise_token_auth_for 'User', at: 'graphql'` line in your routes is responsible for specifying the authentication path (`/graphql/auth`) for your GraphQL API.

2. **Add Authentication Checks in Your Resolvers**: To secure GraphQL endpoints, you should add authentication checks to your GraphQL resolvers. In your resolvers, you can use `before_action` or similar mechanisms to ensure that only authenticated users can access certain mutations or queries.

   Here's an example of how you might add a simple authentication check in a resolver using a `before_action`-like approach:

   ```ruby
   class Mutations::SecureMutation < Mutations::BaseMutation
     # Add this line to require authentication
     before_action :authenticate_user!

     # Define your mutation logic
   end
   ```

   In this example, the `before_action` line ensures that only authenticated users can access the mutation. You can use similar checks in your query resolvers.

3. **Use Current User**: After adding authentication checks, you can access the current authenticated user within your resolvers. The `current_user` method is typically provided by `devise_token_auth` to retrieve the authenticated user. You can use this user to associate records with the current user or enforce authorization rules within your resolvers.

   Here's an example of how you might use `current_user` in a resolver:

   ```ruby
   class Mutations::CreatePost < Mutations::SecureMutation
     argument :title, String, required: true
     argument :body, String, required: true

     field :post, Types::PostType, null: true

     def resolve(title:, body:)
       post = current_user.posts.build(title: title, body: body)

       if post.save
         {
           post: post
         }
       else
         {
           post: nil
         }
       end
     end
   end
   ```

   In this example, `current_user` is used to associate the new post with the currently authenticated user.

By combining these steps, you can secure your GraphQL API endpoints by adding authentication checks and ensuring that only authenticated users can access specific parts of your schema. Additionally, you can use `current_user` to perform actions on behalf of the authenticated user, such as creating records associated with them.

Remember to design your authorization and authentication rules according to your application's requirements and security considerations. You may also want to implement role-based access control and additional security measures as needed.
