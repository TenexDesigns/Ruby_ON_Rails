To implement token authentication in a Rails GraphQL API, you can use the `devise_token_auth` gem as you would in a traditional RESTful API. However, there are some adjustments to be made to accommodate the GraphQL structure. Below are the steps and code samples for adding token-based authentication to your Rails GraphQL API:

**Step 1: Add "devise_token_auth" to Your Gemfile**

Add the `devise` and `devise_token_auth` gems to your Rails application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'devise'
gem 'devise_token_auth'
```

Then, run `bundle install` to install the gems.

**Step 2: Configure Devise and Devise Token Auth**

Run the generators provided by `devise_token_auth` to set up the necessary configurations:

```bash
rails generate devise_token_auth:install User auth
```

This command will generate the required migrations, routes, and configurations for authentication. Here, we're assuming your user model is named "User."

**Step 3: Run Migrations**

Run the migrations to create the necessary database tables:

```bash
rails db:migrate
```

**Step 4: Define User Model and Associations**

In your user model (usually located at `app/models/user.rb`), ensure that it includes the required modules:

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  include DeviseTokenAuth::Concerns::User

  # ... any other associations or validations ...
end
```

**Step 5: Configure Routes**

Ensure that your routes are correctly configured in `config/routes.rb`. You need to mount the authentication routes under the GraphQL endpoint (e.g., `/graphql`).

```ruby
mount_devise_token_auth_for 'User', at: 'graphql'
```

**Step 6: Use Authentication in Your GraphQL API**

Now, you can use the API endpoints provided by `devise_token_auth` to allow users to sign up, sign in, and sign out. Here are some common API endpoints:

- Sign-up: POST to `/graphql/auth` with the user's email, password, and other required information.
- Sign-in: POST to `/graphql/auth/sign_in` with the user's email and password to obtain a token.
- Sign-out: DELETE to `/graphql/auth/sign_out` with the user's token to log the user out.

You can also use the endpoints for account confirmation, password reset, and other authentication-related actions as needed.

**Step 7: Secure Your GraphQL API**

Implement proper security measures, such as using HTTPS, handling token expiration, and handling token refresh, to enhance the security of your GraphQL API.

Regarding the use of namespacing and versioning, you can update the `mount_devise_token_auth_for` line as demonstrated above to accommodate your GraphQL structure and naming conventions. Make sure the endpoint paths align with your GraphQL schema and routes.
