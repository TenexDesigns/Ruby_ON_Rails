In a GraphQL Rails API app, the controllers provided by Devise and Devise Token Auth are not used directly. Instead, you will primarily use mutations and resolvers to handle authentication and user management.

Here's how you can handle authentication and user management in a GraphQL Rails API app:

1. **Authentication:**
   In a GraphQL API, authentication is typically handled using tokens. Devise Token Auth provides a token-based authentication system out of the box. You can use the `authenticate_user!` method in your resolvers to ensure that the user is authenticated before accessing certain data or performing mutations.

   For example, in a resolver for a mutation that requires authentication, you can add the `authenticate_user!` method to ensure that only authenticated users can perform the mutation:

   ```ruby
   class Mutations::CreatePost < Mutations::BaseMutation
     def resolve(title:, body:)
       authenticate_user!

       # Create the post
     end
   end
   ```

   This will ensure that the user is authenticated before executing the resolver logic.

2. **User Registration:**
   In a GraphQL API, user registration can be handled using a mutation. You can create a custom mutation to handle user registration and include any additional fields you want to collect during registration.

   Here's an example of a user registration mutation:

   ```ruby
   class Mutations::RegisterUser < Mutations::BaseMutation
     argument :name, String, required: true
     argument :email, String, required: true
     argument :password, String, required: true

     field :user, Types::UserType, null: true
     field :errors, [String], null: false

     def resolve(name:, email:, password:)
       user = User.new(name: name, email: email, password: password)

       if user.save
         { user: user, errors: [] }
       else
         { user: nil, errors: user.errors.full_messages }
       end
     end
   end
   ```

   This mutation accepts the `name`, `email`, and `password` fields and creates a new user record. It returns the created user if successful, along with any errors that occurred during the registration process.

3. **User Authentication:**
   User authentication can be handled using a mutation as well. You can create a custom mutation to handle user authentication and generate an authentication token.

   Here's an example of a user authentication mutation:

   ```ruby
   class Mutations::AuthenticateUser < Mutations::BaseMutation
     argument :email, String, required: true
     argument :password, String, required: true

     field :user, Types::UserType, null: true
     field :token, String, null: true
     field :errors, [String], null: false

     def resolve(email:, password:)
       user = User.find_by(email: email)

       if user&.valid_password?(password)
         token = user.generate_token
         { user: user, token: token, errors: [] }
       else
         { user: nil, token: nil, errors: ['Invalid email or password'] }
       end
     end
   end
   ```

   This mutation accepts the `email` and `password` fields, finds the user with the provided email, and checks if the password is valid. If the authentication is successful, it returns the authenticated user along with an authentication token. Otherwise, it returns an error message.

4. **Customizing Controllers:**
   In a GraphQL Rails API app, you don't directly use the controllers provided by Devise and Devise Token Auth. Instead, you define your mutations and resolvers to handle the desired functionality.

   The `mount_devise_token_auth_for` line in your routes file is used to set up the necessary routes for token-based authentication. It specifies the `User` model and the path for authentication-related endpoints.

   For example, the line `mount_devise_token_auth_for 'User', at: 'graphql'` sets up the authentication routes under the `/graphql` path.

   This configuration ensures that the necessary authentication routes are available for token-based authentication, but the actual authentication logic is handled within your mutations and resolvers.

5. **Securing Endpoints:**
   In a GraphQL Rails API app, you can secure specific endpoints or fields by adding authentication checks within your resolvers. By using the `authenticate_user!` method or similar authentication checks, you can ensure that only authenticated users can access certain data or perform mutations.

   Additionally, you can use authorization mechanisms, such as role-based access control or permissions, to further restrict access to certain endpoints or fields based on the user's role or permissions.

By following these practices, you can handle authentication and user management in a GraphQL Rails API app using mutations and resolvers, without relying on the controllers provided by Devise and Devise Token Auth directly.
