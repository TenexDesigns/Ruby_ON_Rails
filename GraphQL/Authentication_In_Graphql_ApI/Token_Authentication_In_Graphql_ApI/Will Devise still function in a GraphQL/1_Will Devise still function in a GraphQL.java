Yes, Devise and Devise Token Auth will still function in a GraphQL Rails API app in a similar way to how they do in a REST Rails app. They will still provide authentication tokens to users, and you can customize the lifespan of these tokens.

To access the authentication tokens, you can use the following methods:

* **Sign in:** When a user signs in, the `SessionsController` will generate an authentication token and return it to the user. The user can then store this token and use it to make authenticated requests to your GraphQL API.
* **Sign up:** When a user signs up, the `RegistrationsController` will generate an authentication token and return it to the user. The user can then store this token and use it to make authenticated requests to your GraphQL API.
* **Token refresh:** Users can refresh their authentication tokens using the `TokenValidationsController`. This is useful if the user's token is about to expire.

To make authenticated requests to your GraphQL API, you can pass the authentication token in the `Authorization` header of your request. For example:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN
```

Here is an example of a GraphQL query that uses an authentication token:

```
query {
  users {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

To sign up, sign in, and sign out users in a GraphQL Rails API app, you can use the following mutations:

* **Sign up:**

```
mutation register($email: String!, $password: String!) {
  register(email: $email, password: $password) {
    user {
      id
      name
      email
    }
    token
  }
}
```

* **Sign in:**

```
mutation signIn($email: String!, $password: String!) {
  signIn(email: $email, password: $password) {
    token
  }
}
```

* **Sign out:**

```
mutation signOut {
  signOut
}
```

**Customizing the lifespan of authentication tokens**

You can customize the lifespan of authentication tokens by setting the `devise_token_auth/config/token_lifespan` configuration option. This option sets the maximum amount of time that an authentication token is valid for.

**Conclusion**

Devise and Devise Token Auth can be used to implement token authentication in a GraphQL Rails API app. To do this, you will need to create custom mutations and resolvers to handle authentication and user management. You can also customize the lifespan of authentication tokens.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
