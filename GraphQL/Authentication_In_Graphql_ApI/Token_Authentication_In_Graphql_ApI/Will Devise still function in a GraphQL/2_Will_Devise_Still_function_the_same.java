In a GraphQL Rails API app with Devise and Devise Token Auth, the core functionality of Devise and Devise Token Auth remains the same as in a RESTful API app. Both gems continue to provide authentication, token generation, and user management features, including the ability to customize token lifespan. However, how you interact with these features differs due to the nature of GraphQL.

Here's how it works in the context of GraphQL:

1. **Authentication and Token Generation:**
   - Devise and Devise Token Auth still handle authentication and token generation. When a user signs up or signs in, these gems generate authentication tokens for the user.
   - The lifespan of these tokens can be customized. You can set token expiration and refresh token settings in your Devise Token Auth configuration. The following are some configuration options related to token management:
     - `token_lifespan`: Specifies the lifespan of the authentication token.
     - `batch_request_buffer_throttle`: Allows you to customize the token refresh behavior.

2. **Accessing Tokens:**
   - In a GraphQL context, you typically handle tokens as part of the authentication process and in custom mutations.
   - Upon successful registration or sign-in, Devise Token Auth provides the authentication token in the response. You can access this token and use it for making authenticated GraphQL requests.
   - How you access the token depends on how you structure your GraphQL mutations and how you choose to respond to user actions (e.g., registration, sign-in). You'll typically need to include the token as part of the response to the client.

3. **Making Authenticated Requests:**
   - In GraphQL, you can make authenticated requests by including the authentication token in the request headers.
   - The client (e.g., a web or mobile app) is responsible for storing the token securely and sending it in the headers of GraphQL requests.
   - On the server side, you can implement middleware or custom logic to authenticate requests based on the presence and validity of the token in the request headers.

4. **User Sign-Up, Sign-In, and Sign-Out:**
   - In a GraphQL Rails API, you define custom mutations for user sign-up and sign-in. These custom mutations use the controller methods provided by Devise Token Auth to handle these actions.
   - User sign-up and sign-in can be customized to include validation checks based on your specific requirements (e.g., email format, domain, or additional fields).
   - Sign-out (i.e., logging out) is also handled via custom mutations. You can create a custom mutation for user sign-out and use it to invalidate the authentication token.

In summary, Devise and Devise Token Auth still serve as the underlying mechanisms for authentication and token management in a GraphQL Rails API. However, the way you interact with these features is adapted to the GraphQL architecture. You need to create custom mutations and resolvers to handle user sign-up, sign-in, and other user-related actions. Additionally, the client application should handle token storage and inclusion in GraphQL requests' headers for authentication.
