Implementing token-based authentication in a GraphQL Rails API application typically involves using Devise and Devise Token Auth to manage user authentication and token generation. Below are the steps to implement token-based authentication with code samples:

1. **Set Up Devise and Devise Token Auth**:
   First, make sure you have Devise and Devise Token Auth set up in your Rails application. You can add them to your `Gemfile` and run `bundle install`:

   ```ruby
   gem 'graphql'
   gem 'devise'
   gem 'devise_token_auth'
   ```

   Then, run the generator to set up Devise:

   ```bash
   rails generate devise:install

   ```

   Set up Devise Token Auth:

   ```bash
rails generate devise_token_auth:install
   ```

   Run the migrations to apply the changes:

   ```bash
   rails db:migrate
   ```

   Make sure to configure Devise and Devise Token Auth according to your application's needs, such as specifying the authentication headers and configuring user fields.

2. **Set Up GraphQL**:
   Configure GraphQL in your application if you haven't already. You can use the 'graphql' gem to set up GraphQL endpoints and types.


  --- A_  Use  graphql gem

           this will genrate the  files and folders used by grapql
         
           rails g graphql:install

----B Create User type   ---They enable you to query your data, and determine which data types will be retured thap parten to the requesrted data including the associations
   
   User Type
  
  rails g graphql:object user

   
3. **Create Custom Mutations for Authentication**:
   In your GraphQL application, you can create custom mutations for sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out.

   For example, create a `User` type and mutations for sign-up and sign-in:

   ```ruby
   # app/graphql/types/user_type.rb
   module Types
     class UserType < Types::BaseObject
       field :id, ID, null: false
       field :email, String, null: true
       # Add other user fields as needed
     end
   end
   ```

   ```ruby
   # app/graphql/mutations/sign_up_user.rb
   module Mutations
     class SignUpUser < BaseMutation
       argument :email, String, required: true
       argument :password, String, required: true

       field :user, Types::UserType, null: true
       field :token, String, null: true
       field :errors, [String], null: true

       def resolve(email:, password:)
         user = User.create!(
           email: email,
           password: password
         )

         # Generate an authentication token and set it in the response
         token = user.create_new_auth_token
         context[:session][:token] = token

         {
           user: user,
           token: token['access-token'],
           errors: [],
         }
       rescue ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid => e
         {
           user: nil,
           token: nil,
           errors: e.record.errors.full_messages
         }
       end
     end
   end
   ```

   Similarly, create a mutation for signing in and storing the authentication token in the session:

   ```ruby
   # app/graphql/mutations/sign_in_user.rb
   module Mutations
     class SignInUser < BaseMutation
       argument :email, String, required: true
       argument :password, String, required: true

       field :user, Types::UserType, null: true
       field :token, String, null: true
       field :errors, [String], null: true

       def resolve(email:, password:)
         user = User.find_for_database_authentication(email: email)

         if user && user.valid_password?(password)
           token = user.create_new_auth_token
           context[:session][:token] = token

           {
             user: user,
             token: token['access-token'],
             errors: [],
           }
         else
           {
             user: nil,
             token: nil,
             errors: ['Invalid email or password'],
           }
         end
       end
     end
   end
   ```

4. **Create Sign-Out Mutation**:
   To implement sign-out, create a mutation to clear the authentication token from the session:

   ```ruby
   # app/graphql/mutations/sign_out_user.rb
   module Mutations
     class SignOutUser < BaseMutation
       field :success, Boolean, null: true

       def resolve
         context[:session][:token] = nil # Clear the stored token
         { success: true }
       end
     end
   end
   ```

5. **Update GraphQL Schema and Context**:
   In your GraphQL schema, update it to include these mutations and properly configure the context:

   ```ruby
   # app/graphql/types/mutation_type.rb
   module Types
     class MutationType < Types::BaseObject
       field :signUpUser, mutation: Mutations::SignUpUser
       field :signInUser, mutation: Mutations::SignInUser
       field :signOutUser, mutation: Mutations::SignOutUser
     end
   end
   ```

   Make sure to configure your context in the GraphQL controller to store and retrieve the authentication token as needed.

6. **Authentication in Resolvers**:
   In your resolvers, you can use the authentication token stored in the session to authenticate the user and perform actions based on the user's authorization.

7. **Testing**:
   Test your mutations and resolvers to ensure authentication and authorization work correctly.

These steps should help you implement token-based authentication in a GraphQL Rails API application using Devise and Devise Token Auth. Ensure that you adjust the code to match your specific application requirements and security considerations.

   Configuring the context in the GraphQL controller and using the authentication token in resolvers are essential steps for implementing token-based authentication in a GraphQL Rails API. Below, I'll provide code samples and instructions for these two aspects:

**1. Configure the Context in the GraphQL Controller:**

In your GraphQL controller, you need to configure the context to store and retrieve the authentication token. This allows you to access the user's token when making authenticated requests.

Assuming your `GraphqlController` looks like this:

```ruby
# app/controllers/graphql_controller.rb
class GraphqlController < ApplicationController
  # ...
end
```

You should configure the context within this controller:

```ruby
# app/controllers/graphql_controller.rb
class GraphqlController < ApplicationController
  # ...

  def execute
    variables = prepare_variables(params[:variables])
    query = params[:query]
    operation_name = params[:operationName]

    context = {
      session: session,  # Store session data in the context
      current_user: current_user  # Store the current user for authorization
    }

    result = GraphqlSchema.execute(query, variables: variables, context: context, operation_name: operation_name)
    render json: result
  rescue StandardError => e
    raise e unless Rails.env.development?
    handle_error_in_development(e)
  end

  # ...

end
```

Here, we add two key pieces of information to the context:

- `session`: This stores the user's session data, including the authentication token, which can be accessed within the resolvers.

- `current_user`: This is typically set by Devise and Devise Token Auth, and it stores the authenticated user.

**2. Use the Authentication Token in Resolvers:**

Now that you've configured the context in the controller, you can access the user's session data and authentication token in your GraphQL resolvers.

Let's assume you have a resolver for fetching a user's data, and you want to ensure that it can only be accessed by authenticated users:

```ruby
# app/graphql/resolvers/user_resolver.rb
module Resolvers
  class UserResolver
    def call(_obj, _args, context)
      authenticate_user(context)
      current_user(context)
    end

    private

    def authenticate_user(context)
      # Check if the user's token is present in the session
      token = context[:session][:token]
      raise GraphQL::ExecutionError, 'Authentication required' if token.nil?

      # Perform additional authentication checks, e.g., validate the token
      # You can use Devise Token Auth's `TokenValidationService` here.
    end

    def current_user(context)
      # Retrieve the authenticated user using Devise's `current_user` method
      context[:current_user]
    end
  end
end
```

In this resolver, we have:

- The `authenticate_user` method that checks if the user's token is present in the session. You can implement additional authentication checks here, such as token validation.

- The `current_user` method, which retrieves the authenticated user using Devise's `current_user` method. This provides you with the user's data for further actions.

Now you can use this resolver to fetch user data, and it will ensure that only authenticated users can access it:

```graphql
# Your GraphQL query
query {
  user {
    id
    email
    name
  }
}
```

The `UserResolver` will validate the user's authentication token and return the user's data if the token is valid and the user is authenticated.

By configuring the context and using the authentication token in your resolvers, you ensure that only authenticated users can access specific parts of your GraphQL API and perform actions based on the user's authorization.



















ENSURE AUTHNTICATION IN RESOLVERS
------>Considereing the above two  context, what this means is that after doing the above, we can Use the UserResolver in the above context in other resolvers we make to ensure that the user is signed in, how will that look like, give a sample "Authentication in Resolvers:
In your resolvers, you can use the authentication token stored in the session to authenticate the user and perform actions based on the user's authorization."

    context = {
      session: session,  # Store session data in the context
      current_user: current_user  # Store the current user for authorization
    }

    result = GraphqlSchema.execute(query, variables: variables, context: context, operation_name: operation_name)
    render json: result
  rescue StandardError => e

      current_user(context)
    end

    private

    def authenticate_user(context)
      # Check if the user's token is present in the session
      token = context[:session][:token]
      raise GraphQL::ExecutionError, 'Authentication required' if token.nil?

      # Perform additional authentication checks, e.g., validate the token
      # You can use Devise Token Auth's `TokenValidationService` here.
    end

    def current_user(context)
      # Retrieve the authenticated user using Devise's `current_user` method
      context[:current_user]
    end
  end
end
```

In this resolver, we have:

- The `authenticate_user` method that checks if the user's token is present in the session. You can implement additional authentication checks here, such as token validation.

THE CALL METHOD ABOVE

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




   The `call` method you see in the `CreatePostResolver` and `UserResolver` classes is a convention used in GraphQL-Ruby to handle resolver logic. It's not a built-in Ruby method, but rather a method defined within the resolver classes.

In GraphQL-Ruby, a resolver is a class that defines how to retrieve or manipulate data for a specific field in your GraphQL schema. The `call` method is a user-defined method in a resolver class that gets executed when the corresponding field is queried in a GraphQL request.

Here's what the parameters in the `call` method represent:

1. `_obj`: This parameter is typically used to represent the parent object. In most cases, it's set to `_` to indicate that you're not using the parent object. You might use this parameter if your resolver is for a field that's part of a complex type (e.g., a field within an object type). Since you don't need the parent object in your `UserResolver`, you use `_obj` to indicate that you're not using it.

2. `args`: This parameter contains the arguments provided in the GraphQL query for the field. Resolvers can access and use these arguments to customize their behavior based on the query. In the `CreatePostResolver`, you use `args` to access the `title` and `content` arguments.

3. `context`: The `context` parameter represents the context data associated with the current GraphQL request. This context typically contains information that's shared across all resolvers during the request. In your resolvers, you use the `context` to access the session and authentication information. In the `UserResolver`, you use it to authenticate the user.

The `call` method is not a static or constructor method but a convention used in GraphQL-Ruby resolvers to handle the actual data retrieval or manipulation logic for a field. You create instances of these resolver classes, and when a field is queried in a GraphQL request, the `call` method is called on the respective resolver instance to perform the resolver's logic.

The parameters you see in the `call` method are not strictly required for all resolvers. The usage of parameters, such as `args` or `_obj`, depends on the specific needs of the resolver and the field it's associated with. Some resolvers may not use certain parameters if they are not relevant to the logic of that resolver.

The arguments for the `call` method are provided by GraphQL-Ruby based on the field's definition in your schema. When you define a field in your schema, you can specify the arguments it accepts, and GraphQL-Ruby ensures that these arguments are passed to the resolver's `call` method when the field is queried in a GraphQL request.
