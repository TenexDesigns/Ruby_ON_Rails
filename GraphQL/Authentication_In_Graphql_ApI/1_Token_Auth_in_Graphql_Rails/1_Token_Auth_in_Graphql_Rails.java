Implementing token-based authentication in a GraphQL Rails API application typically involves using Devise and Devise Token Auth to manage user authentication and token generation. Below are the steps to implement token-based authentication with code samples:

1. **Set Up Devise and Devise Token Auth**:
   First, make sure you have Devise and Devise Token Auth set up in your Rails application. You can add them to your `Gemfile` and run `bundle install`:

   ```ruby
   gem 'graphql'
   gem 'devise'
   gem 'devise_token_auth'
   ```

   Then, run the generator to set up Devise:

   ```bash
   rails generate devise:install

   ```

   Set up Devise Token Auth:

   ```bash
rails generate devise_token_auth:install
   ```

   Run the migrations to apply the changes:

   ```bash
   rails db:migrate
   ```

   Make sure to configure Devise and Devise Token Auth according to your application's needs, such as specifying the authentication headers and configuring user fields.

2. **Set Up GraphQL**:
   Configure GraphQL in your application if you haven't already. You can use the 'graphql' gem to set up GraphQL endpoints and types.


  --- A_  Use  graphql gem

           this will genrate the  files and folders used by grapql
         
           rails g graphql:install

----B Create User type   ---They enable you to query your data, and determine which data types will be retured thap parten to the requesrted data including the associations
   
   User Type
  
  rails g graphql:object user

   
3. **Create Custom Mutations for Authentication**:
   In your GraphQL application, you can create custom mutations for sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out.

   For example, create a `User` type and mutations for sign-up and sign-in:

   ```ruby
   # app/graphql/types/user_type.rb
   module Types
     class UserType < Types::BaseObject
       field :id, ID, null: false
       field :email, String, null: true
       # Add other user fields as needed
     end
   end
   ```

   ```ruby
   # app/graphql/mutations/sign_up_user.rb
   module Mutations
     class SignUpUser < BaseMutation
       argument :email, String, required: true
       argument :password, String, required: true

       field :user, Types::UserType, null: true
       field :token, String, null: true
       field :errors, [String], null: true

       def resolve(email:, password:)
         user = User.create!(
           email: email,
           password: password
         )

         # Generate an authentication token and set it in the response
         token = user.create_new_auth_token
         context[:session][:token] = token

         {
           user: user,
           token: token['access-token'],
           errors: [],
         }
       rescue ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid => e
         {
           user: nil,
           token: nil,
           errors: e.record.errors.full_messages
         }
       end
     end
   end
   ```

   Similarly, create a mutation for signing in and storing the authentication token in the session:

   ```ruby
   # app/graphql/mutations/sign_in_user.rb
   module Mutations
     class SignInUser < BaseMutation
       argument :email, String, required: true
       argument :password, String, required: true

       field :user, Types::UserType, null: true
       field :token, String, null: true
       field :errors, [String], null: true

       def resolve(email:, password:)
         user = User.find_for_database_authentication(email: email)

         if user && user.valid_password?(password)
           token = user.create_new_auth_token
           context[:session][:token] = token

           {
             user: user,
             token: token['access-token'],
             errors: [],
           }
         else
           {
             user: nil,
             token: nil,
             errors: ['Invalid email or password'],
           }
         end
       end
     end
   end
   ```

4. **Create Sign-Out Mutation**:
   To implement sign-out, create a mutation to clear the authentication token from the session:

   ```ruby
   # app/graphql/mutations/sign_out_user.rb
   module Mutations
     class SignOutUser < BaseMutation
       field :success, Boolean, null: true

       def resolve
         context[:session][:token] = nil # Clear the stored token
         { success: true }
       end
     end
   end
   ```

5. **Update GraphQL Schema and Context**:
   In your GraphQL schema, update it to include these mutations and properly configure the context:

   ```ruby
   # app/graphql/types/mutation_type.rb
   module Types
     class MutationType < Types::BaseObject
       field :signUpUser, mutation: Mutations::SignUpUser
       field :signInUser, mutation: Mutations::SignInUser
       field :signOutUser, mutation: Mutations::SignOutUser
     end
   end
   ```

   Make sure to configure your context in the GraphQL controller to store and retrieve the authentication token as needed.

6. **Authentication in Resolvers**:
   In your resolvers, you can use the authentication token stored in the session to authenticate the user and perform actions based on the user's authorization.

7. **Testing**:
   Test your mutations and resolvers to ensure authentication and authorization work correctly.

These steps should help you implement token-based authentication in a GraphQL Rails API application using Devise and Devise Token Auth. Ensure that you adjust the code to match your specific application requirements and security considerations.














----> HOW TO PERFORM THE AUTORIZATION
How to perform the follwing with code samples in the above  context Make sure to configure your context in the GraphQL controller to store and retrieve the authentication token as needed.  and In your resolvers, you can use the authentication token stored in the session to authenticate the user and perform actions based on the user's authorization.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


   Configuring the context in the GraphQL controller and using the authentication token in resolvers are essential steps for implementing token-based authentication in a GraphQL Rails API. Below, I'll provide code samples and instructions for these two aspects:

**1. Configure the Context in the GraphQL Controller:**

In your GraphQL controller, you need to configure the context to store and retrieve the authentication token. This allows you to access the user's token when making authenticated requests.

Assuming your `GraphqlController` looks like this:

```ruby
# app/controllers/graphql_controller.rb
class GraphqlController < ApplicationController
  # ...
end
```

You should configure the context within this controller:

```ruby
# app/controllers/graphql_controller.rb
class GraphqlController < ApplicationController
  # ...

  def execute
    variables = prepare_variables(params[:variables])
    query = params[:query]
    operation_name = params[:operationName]

    context = {
      session: session,  # Store session data in the context
      current_user: current_user  # Store the current user for authorization
    }

    result = GraphqlSchema.execute(query, variables: variables, context: context, operation_name: operation_name)
    render json: result
  rescue StandardError => e
    raise e unless Rails.env.development?
    handle_error_in_development(e)
  end

  # ...

end
```

Here, we add two key pieces of information to the context:

- `session`: This stores the user's session data, including the authentication token, which can be accessed within the resolvers.

- `current_user`: This is typically set by Devise and Devise Token Auth, and it stores the authenticated user.

**2. Use the Authentication Token in Resolvers:**

Now that you've configured the context in the controller, you can access the user's session data and authentication token in your GraphQL resolvers.

Let's assume you have a resolver for fetching a user's data, and you want to ensure that it can only be accessed by authenticated users:

```ruby
# app/graphql/resolvers/user_resolver.rb
module Resolvers
  class UserResolver
    def call(_obj, _args, context)
      authenticate_user(context)
      current_user(context)
    end

    private

    def authenticate_user(context)
      # Check if the user's token is present in the session
      token = context[:session][:token]
      raise GraphQL::ExecutionError, 'Authentication required' if token.nil?

      # Perform additional authentication checks, e.g., validate the token
      # You can use Devise Token Auth's `TokenValidationService` here.
    end

    def current_user(context)
      # Retrieve the authenticated user using Devise's `current_user` method
      context[:current_user]
    end
  end
end
```

In this resolver, we have:

- The `authenticate_user` method that checks if the user's token is present in the session. You can implement additional authentication checks here, such as token validation.

- The `current_user` method, which retrieves the authenticated user using Devise's `current_user` method. This provides you with the user's data for further actions.

Now you can use this resolver to fetch user data, and it will ensure that only authenticated users can access it:

```graphql
# Your GraphQL query
query {
  user {
    id
    email
    name
  }
}
```

The `UserResolver` will validate the user's authentication token and return the user's data if the token is valid and the user is authenticated.

By configuring the context and using the authentication token in your resolvers, you ensure that only authenticated users can access specific parts of your GraphQL API and perform actions based on the user's authorization.



















ENSURE AUTHNTICATION IN RESOLVERS
------>Considereing the above two  context, what this means is that after doing the above, we can Use the UserResolver in the above context in other resolvers we make to ensure that the user is signed in, how will that look like, give a sample "Authentication in Resolvers:
In your resolvers, you can use the authentication token stored in the session to authenticate the user and perform actions based on the user's authorization."
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



You can use the `UserResolver` I mentioned earlier as a building block for ensuring user authentication in other resolvers. When implementing authentication in resolvers, you can call the `UserResolver` to verify that the user is signed in before allowing them to perform specific actions. Here's how it would look in another resolver:

Suppose you have another resolver for creating a new post, and you want to ensure that only authenticated users can create posts. Here's an example of how you can use the `UserResolver` in this context:

```ruby
# app/graphql/resolvers/create_post_resolver.rb
module Resolvers
  class CreatePostResolver
    def call(_obj, args, context)
      user = user_resolver(context)

      # Your authentication logic here, e.g., checking user roles or permissions
      if user
        # Create a new post here
        post = Post.create(
          title: args[:title],
          content: args[:content],
          user: user
        )

        # Return the created post
        post
      else
        # Handle unauthorized access
        raise GraphQL::ExecutionError, 'Unauthorized: You must be signed in to create a post'
      end
    end

    private

    def user_resolver(context)
      UserResolver.new.call(nil, nil, context)
    end
  end
end
```

In this example, the `CreatePostResolver` calls the `UserResolver` to authenticate the user. If the user is authenticated, you can proceed to create the post. If the user is not signed in, you raise a GraphQL execution error to handle unauthorized access.

You can follow a similar pattern in other resolvers where you need to perform authentication checks. The `UserResolver` is a reusable component that helps ensure user authentication in different parts of your GraphQL API.

   






















   


THE CALL METHOD ABOVE

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




   The `call` method you see in the `CreatePostResolver` and `UserResolver` classes is a convention used in GraphQL-Ruby to handle resolver logic. It's not a built-in Ruby method, but rather a method defined within the resolver classes.

In GraphQL-Ruby, a resolver is a class that defines how to retrieve or manipulate data for a specific field in your GraphQL schema. The `call` method is a user-defined method in a resolver class that gets executed when the corresponding field is queried in a GraphQL request.

Here's what the parameters in the `call` method represent:

1. `_obj`: This parameter is typically used to represent the parent object. In most cases, it's set to `_` to indicate that you're not using the parent object. You might use this parameter if your resolver is for a field that's part of a complex type (e.g., a field within an object type). Since you don't need the parent object in your `UserResolver`, you use `_obj` to indicate that you're not using it.

2. `args`: This parameter contains the arguments provided in the GraphQL query for the field. Resolvers can access and use these arguments to customize their behavior based on the query. In the `CreatePostResolver`, you use `args` to access the `title` and `content` arguments.

3. `context`: The `context` parameter represents the context data associated with the current GraphQL request. This context typically contains information that's shared across all resolvers during the request. In your resolvers, you use the `context` to access the session and authentication information. In the `UserResolver`, you use it to authenticate the user.

The `call` method is not a static or constructor method but a convention used in GraphQL-Ruby resolvers to handle the actual data retrieval or manipulation logic for a field. You create instances of these resolver classes, and when a field is queried in a GraphQL request, the `call` method is called on the respective resolver instance to perform the resolver's logic.

The parameters you see in the `call` method are not strictly required for all resolvers. The usage of parameters, such as `args` or `_obj`, depends on the specific needs of the resolver and the field it's associated with. Some resolvers may not use certain parameters if they are not relevant to the logic of that resolver.

The arguments for the `call` method are provided by GraphQL-Ruby based on the field's definition in your schema. When you define a field in your schema, you can specify the arguments it accepts, and GraphQL-Ruby ensures that these arguments are passed to the resolver's `call` method when the field is queried in a GraphQL request.











   

HOW TO SEND AND RECEIVE ARGUMENT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In GraphQL, arguments for a resolver are not explicitly sent as a single `params` object like in traditional RESTful APIs. Instead, the arguments for a resolver are automatically generated based on the GraphQL query's structure and the schema definition. When you define a field in your GraphQL schema, you can specify which arguments it accepts, and these arguments are automatically passed to the resolver's `call` method when that field is queried in a GraphQL request. GraphQL-Ruby takes care of parsing the query and providing the resolver with the relevant arguments.

For example, let's say you have a GraphQL query like this:

```graphql
query {
  createPost(title: "My New Post", content: "This is the content of the post") {
    id
    title
  }
}
```

In this query, `createPost` is a field, and it accepts two arguments: `title` and `content`. When this query is executed, GraphQL-Ruby will automatically provide these arguments to the resolver for the `createPost` field, and you can access them as `args[:title]` and `args[:content]` in the resolver's `call` method, just like in your `CreatePostResolver` example.

Regarding parameter sanitization, GraphQL inherently provides a mechanism for controlling which fields and arguments are accessible to clients. In GraphQL, you specify exactly which fields and arguments are allowed for each type and field in your schema. By default, only fields and arguments that you explicitly define in your schema are accessible to clients. Any other fields or arguments will be rejected by the server.

You don't need to use `params.permit` or similar mechanisms commonly used in RESTful APIs for parameter sanitization. Instead, you have fine-grained control over your schema definition, and you can specify exactly which fields and arguments are allowed. This is one of the strengths of GraphQL, as it allows you to define a strict schema that matches your application's data model and only exposes the fields and arguments that you want to make available.

If you ever want to restrict certain arguments for a field based on authentication or authorization, you can include logic in your resolvers to perform those checks and decide whether to allow or deny access to certain arguments. This is typically done within the resolver functions based on your application's specific requirements.

In your `CreatePostResolver`, you have authentication logic to check if the user is authorized to create a post. If the user is authorized, you proceed with creating the post, and if not, you raise a `GraphQL::ExecutionError` to handle unauthorized access. This is a common approach to adding authentication and authorization logic to your resolvers.

Overall, GraphQL provides a robust way to control and define what data is accessible through your API, and you can use resolvers to enforce the business logic and access control as needed.








   















ANOTHER VESRION OF THE ANSWER IN THE ABOVE CONTEXT
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   In GraphQL, arguments are not sent as part of the request URL or as a single "params" object like in traditional RESTful APIs. Instead, arguments for specific fields are defined in the GraphQL schema, and clients specify them directly in their queries. GraphQL queries allow clients to request only the data they need, and the server responds with the requested data in a structured format.

Here's how arguments work in GraphQL:

1. Field Definition: In your GraphQL schema, when you define a field, you can specify the arguments it accepts. For example, you might define a field like this:

   ```graphql
   type Query {
     getUser(id: ID!): User
   }
   ```

   In this example, the `getUser` field accepts an argument named `id`, which is required and of type `ID`.

2. Query with Arguments: When a client wants to retrieve data for a field that accepts arguments, they specify the arguments in their GraphQL query. For example:

   ```graphql
   query {
     getUser(id: "123") {
       name
       email
     }
   }
   ```

   In this query, the client is requesting the `name` and `email` fields for the `User` with an `id` of "123."

3. Resolver Usage: In your resolver for the `getUser` field, you will receive the `id` argument as a parameter in the `call` method. You can access and use this argument to customize the logic for retrieving the user with the specified ID.

In your resolvers, you don't need to worry about parameter sanitization or using `params.permit` like in traditional RESTful APIs. GraphQL provides a clear schema definition that specifies the valid arguments for each field. The arguments are defined in your schema, and GraphQL-Ruby enforces that only valid arguments are allowed when executing queries.

GraphQL-Ruby automatically validates incoming queries and ensures that they conform to the defined schema. If a client tries to request fields or arguments that are not part of the schema, GraphQL-Ruby will reject the query and return an error.

So, you don't need to explicitly permit or sanitize parameters in the same way you would in a RESTful API. Instead, you rely on the schema definition to validate and restrict the arguments that can be used in queries. This is one of the benefits of GraphQL, as it helps reduce over-fetching and under-fetching of data and allows clients to request only the data they need.


















ERRORS ------>   "uninitialized constant GraphqlController::GraphqlSchema,"  THIS IS AN ERRO WE ENCOUNTERED

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The error message you're encountering, "uninitialized constant GraphqlController::GraphqlSchema," suggests that there's a problem finding the GraphQL schema class in your application.

In your `GraphqlController`, you have this line of code:

```ruby
result = GraphqlSchema.execute(query, variables: variables, context: context, operation_name: operation_name)
```

It seems like your GraphQL schema class is named `TokenSchema`, as seen in your `token_schema.rb` file. If you are using a schema named `TokenSchema`, you should update the line in your `GraphqlController` to:

```ruby
result = TokenSchema.execute(query, variables: variables, context: context, operation_name: operation_name)
```

Make sure that the schema class name used in your controller matches the actual schema class you have defined in your application.

So, in summary, update your `GraphqlController` to use `TokenSchema` instead of `GraphqlSchema` to match the name of your GraphQL schema class:

```ruby
result = TokenSchema.execute(query, variables: variables, context: context, operation_name: operation_name)
```

This should resolve the "uninitialized constant" error you're encountering.
