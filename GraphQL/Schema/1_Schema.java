In GraphQL, the schema is a critical component that defines the structure of your API, including the available queries, mutations, and types. The schema serves as a contract between the client and the server, specifying what operations can be performed and the shape of the data that can be requested or modified. Here's a more detailed explanation of the schema in the context of GraphQL:

1. **Schema Definition:**
   - **Role:** The schema is the central piece of your GraphQL API. It defines the operations (queries and mutations) that clients can execute and the data types returned by those operations.
   - **Usage:** You define the schema by creating a schema class (in Ruby on Rails, often named `GraphqlSchema`) that uses a schema builder (e.g., the one provided by the GraphQL-Ruby gem). Within the schema class, you specify the query and mutation types available in your API.

   Example:
   ```ruby
   class GraphqlSchema < GraphQL::Schema
     mutation(Types::MutationType)
     query(Types::QueryType)
   end
   ```

2. **Query Type:**
   - **Role:** The query type defines the available queries in your API. Queries are used to retrieve data from the server. Each field within the query type represents a query operation.
   - **Usage:** You define the query type within the schema and specify the fields representing the queries. These fields typically have resolver functions that retrieve data when the queries are executed.

   Example:
   ```ruby
   module Types
     class QueryType < Types::BaseObject
       field :users, [Types::UserType], null: false
       field :user, Types::UserType, null: false
     end
   end
   ```

3. **Mutation Type:**
   - **Role:** The mutation type defines the available mutations in your API. Mutations are used to modify data on the server, such as creating, updating, or deleting records.
   - **Usage:** Similar to the query type, you define the mutation type within the schema and specify the fields representing the mutations. These fields have resolver functions that handle the logic for data modifications.

   Example:
   ```ruby
   module Types
     class MutationType < Types::BaseObject
       field :createUser, mutation: Mutations::CreateUser
       field :updateUser, mutation: Mutations::UpdateUser
     end
   end
   ```

4. **Data Types:**
   - **Role:** The schema also defines the data types, which represent the structure of the data that can be queried or mutated. Data types are composed of fields, and
