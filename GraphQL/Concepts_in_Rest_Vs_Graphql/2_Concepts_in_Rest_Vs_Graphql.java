The concepts you mentioned are still valid in GraphQL APIs, but they may be implemented differently.

Validations

Validations can be implemented in GraphQL APIs using resolvers. For example, the CreateUserMutation resolver could validate the name and email arguments before creating the new user.

Here is an example of how to validate the name argument:

Ruby
class CreateUserMutation < Mutations::BaseMutation
  argument :name, String, required: true
  argument :email, String, required: true

  field :user, Types::UserType, null: false
  field :errors, [String], null: false

  def resolve(name:, email:)
    if name.blank?
      errors << "Name is required."
    end

    if email.blank?
      errors << "Email is required."
    end

    if errors.empty?
      user = User.new(name: name, email: email)
      user.save
      {
        user: user,
        errors: []
      }
    else
      {
        user: nil,
        errors: errors
      }
    end
  end
end

Error handling

Error handling in GraphQL APIs is similar to error handling in RESTful APIs. You can use resolvers to catch and handle errors, or you can use a middleware to handle errors globally.

Here is an example of how to handle errors in a resolver:

Ruby
class CreateUserMutation < Mutations::BaseMutation
  argument :name, String, required: true
  argument :email, String, required: true

  field :user, Types::UserType, null: false
  field :errors, [String], null: false

  def resolve(name:, email:)
    if name.blank?
      errors << "Name is required."
    end

    if email.blank?
      errors << "Email is required."
    end

    if errors.empty?
      user = User.new(name: name, email: email)
      user.save
      {
        user: user,
        errors: []
      }
    else
      raise GraphQL::ExecutionError.new(errors.join("\n"))
    end
  end
end
Use code with caution. Learn more
If an error occurs in this resolver, a GraphQL::ExecutionError will be raised. This error will be returned to the client in the response.

Namespaces and versioning

Namespaces and versioning can be implemented in GraphQL APIs using schema stitching. Schema stitching allows you to combine multiple GraphQL schemas into a single schema. You can then use namespaces and versioning to organize and version your schemas.

Here is an example of how to use schema stitching to implement namespaces:

Ruby
# app/graphql/types/users/user_type.rb
module Users
  class UserType < Types::BaseObject
    field :id, ID, null: false
    field :name, String, null: true
    field :email, String, null: true
  end
end
Use code with caution. Learn more
Ruby
# app/graphql/types/posts/post_type.rb
module Posts
  class PostType < Types::BaseObject
    field :id, ID, null: false
    field :title, String, null: false
    field :body, String, null: false
  end
end
Use code with caution. Learn more
Ruby
# app/graphql/types/query_type.rb
class QueryType < Types::BaseObject
  field :users, [Users::UserType], null: false

  def users
    User.all
  end
end
Use code with caution. Learn more
This code defines two GraphQL schemas: one for users and one for posts. The QueryType schema then stitches the two schemas together and exposes the users field.

You can use a similar approach to implement versioning. Simply create a separate schema for each version of your API. Then, use schema stitching to combine the schemas and expose the versions to your clients.

Callbacks

Callbacks can be implemented in GraphQL APIs using resolvers. For example, you could create a resolver for the before_create callback on the User model.

Here is an example of a resolver for the before_create callback:

Ruby
class BeforeCreateUserResolver < GraphQL::Schema::Resolver
  type Types::UserType, null: false

  def resolve(user:)
    user.email = user.email.downcase
    user
  end
end
Use code with caution. Learn more
This resolver will be called before a new user is created. It will downcase the user's email address before saving the user.

You can use a similar approach to implement other callbacks in GraphQL APIs.

**HTTP status





-------------------





  The following concepts you mentioned are also valid in GraphQL APIs, but they may be implemented differently:

HTTP status codes

HTTP status codes are still used in GraphQL APIs. The status code of the response will indicate whether the operation was successful or not. For example, a status code of 200 OK indicates that the operation was successful, while a status code of 400 Bad Request indicates that the operation was unsuccessful due to a client error.

Routes

Routes are still used in GraphQL APIs, but they may be implemented differently. In a RESTful API, each route typically corresponds to a single resource or operation. In a GraphQL API, all routes typically correspond to a single endpoint, the /graphql endpoint.

Serialization and deserialization

Serialization and deserialization are still used in GraphQL APIs. When a client sends a request to the /graphql endpoint, the request body is serialized into a JSON object. The GraphQL server then deserializes the JSON object into a GraphQL query or mutation. The GraphQL server then executes the query or mutation and serializes the response into a JSON object. The response is then sent back to the client.

N+1 problems

N+1 problems can still occur in GraphQL APIs, but there are a few things you can do to avoid them. One thing you can do is to use batching to fetch multiple records in a single query. Another thing you can do is to use preloading to fetch associated records along with the parent record.

Parameter sanitization

Parameter sanitization is still important in GraphQL APIs. You should sanitize all input parameters before using them in your resolvers. This will help to protect your API from attacks.

Authentication and authorization with tokens

Authentication and authorization with tokens can still be used in GraphQL APIs. You can use a library such as JWT to generate and validate tokens. You can then use the tokens to authenticate and authorize users.

Rate refreshing

Rate refresh can be implemented in GraphQL APIs using a middleware. The middleware can track the number of requests a user makes within a certain period of time. If the user makes too many requests, the middleware can return an error.

Request, path, and query parameters

Request, path, and query parameters are still used in GraphQL APIs. The client can send request, path, and query parameters to the /graphql endpoint. The GraphQL server can then use these parameters to filter the results of queries or to determine which mutations
