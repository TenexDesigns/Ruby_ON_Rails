NOW that we are using graph ql, what about the many concepts we used in restful apis like validations,erro handling, namespacing  and versioning, callbacks,
  http status codes , routes, serialization and desirialzation, N+1 problems, parameter sanitization, authentican and autorzation with tokens , rate refreshing , request , path ,query parameters and many others, do they all go out the windows or they are also valid in graphql apis and how do we implemnt them ith code samples in the above rails api with graphq , 
  with code samples

While GraphQL changes how clients communicate with your server, many concepts from RESTful APIs still apply:

1. **Validations**: Just like in RESTful APIs, you can use ActiveRecord validations in your models. In your mutations, after attempting to save a record, you can check if it has any errors and return them. Here's an example from your `CreateUser` mutation:

    ```ruby
    def resolve(name:, email:)
      user = User.new(name: name, email: email)
      if user.save
        {
          user: user,
          errors: []
        }
      else
        {
          user: nil,
          errors: user.errors.full_messages
        }
      end
    end
    ```

    In this example, if `user.save` fails due to a validation error, `user.errors.full_messages` will contain the validation error messages.

2. **Error Handling**: In GraphQL, errors can be handled at different levels. Field-level errors can be handled in the resolver methods. For unhandled errors, GraphQL provides an `errors` key in the response which contains error details. You can also customize error handling by defining `rescue_from` handlers in your schema.

3. **Namespacing and Versioning**: In REST, you can have different versions of your API by namespacing your routes. In GraphQL, instead of versioning your API, you can deprecate old fields and add new fields. This allows clients to gradually move from old fields to new fields.

4. **Callbacks**: Just like in RESTful APIs, you can use ActiveRecord callbacks in your models.

5. **HTTP Status Codes**: In REST, you use HTTP status codes to indicate the status of a request. In GraphQL, every response has a status code of 200, and errors are handled in the response body under the `errors` field.

6. **Routes**: In a RESTful API, you define multiple routes for different resources. In GraphQL, all requests are sent to a single endpoint, typically `/graphql`.

7. **Serialization and Deserialization**: In GraphQL, you define types for your data, and GraphQL takes care of serializing and deserializing the data. You don't need to manually serialize/deserialize data like in a RESTful API.

8. **N+1 Problem**: The N+1 problem can still occur in GraphQL. You can solve it using the `graphql-batch` gem or the built-in `batch_load` method in the `graphql` gem.

9. **Parameter Sanitization**: In GraphQL, instead of sanitizing parameters, you define strict types for your inputs. This ensures that the data is in the correct format.

10. **Authentication and Authorization**: You can still use token-based authentication in GraphQL. You can provide the token in the HTTP header, and then in your GraphQL context, you can verify the token and set the current user. For authorization, you can check if the current user has the necessary permissions in your resolvers.

11. **Rate Limiting**: You can implement rate limiting in GraphQL using Rack middleware, similar to how you would do it in a RESTful API.

12. **Request, Path, and Query Parameters**: In GraphQL, you pass all parameters in the request body, not in the path or query parameters. You define these parameters in your queries and mutations.

Remember, while GraphQL changes how you structure your API, many concepts from RESTful APIs are still relevant and can be used in a similar way in your GraphQL API. For more details on how to implement these concepts in GraphQL, you can refer to resources like [graphql-ruby](https://graphql-ruby.org/), [How to GraphQL](https://www.howtographql.com/), and [GraphQL.org](https://graphql.org/learn/).
