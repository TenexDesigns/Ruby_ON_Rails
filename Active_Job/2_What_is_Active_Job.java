The article discusses Active Job in Ruby on Rails, which is a framework for handling background jobs. Here's a breakdown of the key points in the article with some code examples:

1. **Introduction to ActiveJob**: ActiveJob is a framework in Rails that enables you to set up background jobs and execute them on various asynchronous queuing backends. It provides an abstraction layer that can work with different background job frameworks like Delayed Job, Sidekiq, Resque, and more.

2. **Background Jobs**: The article explains the concept of background jobs and why they are important. Running certain tasks outside the typical request/response cycle can improve the performance of your application. Background jobs are ideal for tasks like sending emails, processing videos, uploading large files, and more.

3. **ActiveJob Example**: The article provides an example of how to use ActiveJob to send a welcome email to users when they register for an application. It outlines the following steps:

   - Create a `UserMailer` for sending emails.
   - Create an ActiveJob class to handle background tasks.
   - Send a "welcome email" to new users after they sign up.
   - Set up the background job with a queuing library like Sidekiq.
   - Call the mailer from the ActiveJob to send emails.

   The example demonstrates how ActiveJob simplifies the process of handling background tasks and integrates with various queuing libraries.

4. **Enqueue Job**: ActiveJob provides methods for enqueuing jobs for execution. You can specify when a job should run, and it can be scheduled with various options such as `wait` or `wait_until`. For example:

   ```ruby
   SendEmailsJob.set(wait: 1.week).perform_later(user)
   SendEmailsJob.set(wait_until: Date.tomorrow.noon).perform_later(user)
   ```

5. **Callbacks**: ActiveJob supports callbacks that allow you to trigger logic at different points during a job's lifecycle. You can use standard callback methods, similar to Rails callbacks, to perform actions before and after a job is executed.

   ```ruby
   class SendEmailsJob < ApplicationJob
     before_perform { |job| puts job.arguments }
     around_perform :around_cleanup
     after_perform do |job|
       # Do something with the record
     end

     def perform
       # Do something later
     end

     private
     def around_cleanup
       # Do something before and after perform
     end
   end
   ```

6. **Retry On**: ActiveJob provides options for retrying failed jobs. You can use the `retry_on` or `discard_on` methods to specify whether a job should be retried after a failure. You can configure the retry interval and the maximum number of retry attempts.

The article highlights how ActiveJob simplifies the process of managing background jobs, making it easier to work with different queuing backends and providing features like scheduling, callbacks, and retry mechanisms. It's a powerful tool for improving the performance and reliability of Rails applications with background tasks.
