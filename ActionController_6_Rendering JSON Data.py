In Ruby on Rails, ActionController provides the ability to render JSON data as responses to HTTP requests. 
Rendering JSON is a common practice for building APIs or responding with structured data that can be consumed 
by client applications. Heres how you can render JSON data in your controllers:

Rendering a Hash or Object as JSON:
You can render a Ruby hash or object as JSON using the render method and specifying the json format. For example:


class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def index
    users = User.all
    render json: users
  end
end
In this example, the index action retrieves all users from the database and renders them as JSON.

Customizing the JSON Response:
You can customize the JSON response by selecting specific attributes, including associations, 
or even including additional data. For example:


class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def show
    user = User.find(params[:id])
    render json: user, only: [:id, :name], include: :posts
  end
end
In this example, the show action retrieves a specific user from the database and renders their id and name attributes.
It also includes the associated posts records.

Rendering JSON Arrays:
You can render an array of objects as JSON by passing the array to the render method. For example:


class ProductsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    products = Product.all
    render json: products
  end
end
In this example, the index action retrieves all products from the database and renders them as an array of JSON objects.

Handling JSON Errors:
If an error occurs while processing a request, you can render JSON with an error status code and an error message. For example:


class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def create
    user = User.new(user_params)

    if user.save
      render json: user
    else
      render json: { error: user.errors.full_messages }, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  end

  private

  def user_params
    params.require(:user).permit(:name, :email)
  end
end
In this example, the create action attempts to save a new user. If the save is successful, 
the user is rendered as JSON. Otherwise, an error response with the error messages is rendered with 
a status code of :unprocessable_entity.

Rendering JSON data in ActionController allows you to provide structured responses to client applications.
By customizing the JSON output, you can control what data is included and exclude sensitive information. 
This is particularly useful when building APIs or serving data to front-end frameworks.
