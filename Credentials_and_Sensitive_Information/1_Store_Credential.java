Storing sensitive information in a Rails GraphQL API is an essential security practice. The approach you mentioned in your question, which involves using Rails' credentials system, is a recommended and secure way to store sensitive data. Here's why it's a good approach:

1. **Security:** Credentials are stored in an encrypted format in the `config/credentials.yml.enc` file. The encryption is based on a secret key stored in `config/master.key`. This ensures that sensitive information is not exposed in plain text, even if your configuration files are version controlled.

2. **Easy Collaboration:** Using Rails' credentials system allows you to securely collaborate with other developers by sharing the `master.key` file, which is not part of your version control system. This way, your team members can work with sensitive data without exposing it in the repository.

3. **Environment Independence:** Credentials are environment-independent. They can be used across different environments (development, production, etc.) without the need to manually set up environment variables for each environment. This makes it easier to manage configuration across different stages of your application's lifecycle.

Here's how to use the Rails credentials system to store sensitive information:

1. **Generate a Secret Key:**

   First, you need to generate a secret key. You can do this using the following command:

   ```bash
   rails credentials:edit
   ```

   This will open an editor with the unencrypted contents of `config/credentials.yml.enc`. When you save and close your editor, the contents will be encrypted and saved.

2. **Edit Sensitive Information:**

   In the editor, you can add your sensitive information, such as API keys, database passwords, or SMTP credentials. For example, you can add your SMTP username and password as shown in your example.

3. **Access Sensitive Information:**

   In your application code, you can access the sensitive information using the `Rails.application.credentials` object. For example:

   ```ruby
   smtp_username = Rails.application.credentials.smtp[:user_name]
   smtp_password = Rails.application.credentials.smtp[:password]
   ```

4. **Sharing the `master.key`:**

   It's important to securely share the `master.key` with your team members. The `master.key` should not be part of your version control system. You can share it through a secure channel like a password manager or a secure document sharing service.

This approach provides a good balance between security and convenience, making it a recommended method for storing sensitive information in a Rails GraphQL API. It's generally safer and more manageable than using environment variables or plain text configuration files.
