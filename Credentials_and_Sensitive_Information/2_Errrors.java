The error message you're seeing is because Rails is trying to open the `config/credentials.yml.enc` file for editing, but it doesn't know which text editor to use because the `EDITOR` environment variable is not set. To resolve this issue, you should set the `EDITOR` environment variable to your preferred text editor.

Here's how you can set the `EDITOR` variable and open the credentials file for editing:

1. Determine which text editor you want to use. You can use any text editor you prefer. Common choices include `nano`, `vim`, `subl` (Sublime Text), `code` (Visual Studio Code), `notepad`, etc.

2. Set the `EDITOR` environment variable to your preferred text editor. You can do this in the command prompt or terminal:

   - For example, to use Visual Studio Code as your text editor, run:

     ```bash
     export EDITOR="code --wait"
     ```

   - If you're using Notepad on Windows, you can run:

     ```bash
     export EDITOR="notepad"
     ```

   Make sure to use the appropriate command for your chosen text editor.

3. After setting the `EDITOR` variable, run the `rails credentials:edit` command again:

   ```bash
   rails credentials:edit
   ```

This should open the credentials file in your chosen text editor, allowing you to edit and save your sensitive information securely.






----------------------------------------------------------


I apologize for the confusion. The `export` command I provided is commonly used in Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS). For Windows, you should use the `set` command to set environment variables. To set the `EDITOR` environment variable in Windows, follow these steps:

1. Open a Command Prompt as an administrator. You can do this by searching for "Command Prompt" in the Start menu, right-clicking it, and selecting "Run as administrator."

2. Use the `set` command to set the `EDITOR` environment variable to your preferred text editor. For example, if you want to use Notepad, run:

   ```bash
   set EDITOR=notepad
   ```

   If you want to use Visual Studio Code with the `--wait` flag, you can run:

   ```bash
   set EDITOR=code --wait
   ```

   Make sure to use the appropriate command for your chosen text editor.

3. After setting the `EDITOR` variable, run the `rails credentials:edit` command again:

   ```bash
   rails credentials:edit
   ```

This should open the credentials file in your chosen text editor.
