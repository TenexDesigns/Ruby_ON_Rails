The N+1 query problem is a common performance issue that occurs when retrieving associations in a loop,
resulting in multiple additional queries being executed for each record.
It can lead to significant performance degradation, especially when dealing with large datasets.
Lets take a closer look at the problem and its solution.

N+1 Query Problem:
Consider a scenario where you have a User model that has many Posts, and you want to retrieve all users
and their associated posts. One approach to retrieve this data is as follows:


users = User.all
users.each do |user|
  puts user.posts
end

In the above code, you first retrieve all users using User.all, and then for each user,
you access the associated posts using user.posts. The issue here is that for each user, 
a separate query is executed to fetch their posts, resulting in N+1 queries.
If you have 100 users, it will result in 101 queries (1 for users and 100 for posts).

Solution: Eager Loading:
The solution to the N+1 query problem is eager loading
, which involves loading the associated records in advance to minimize additional queries.
In Rails, you can use the includes method to eager load associations.


users = User.includes(:posts)
users.each do |user|
  puts user.posts
end

By using includes(:posts), Rails performs a single query to fetch all users and their associated posts in one go. 
This way, you avoid the N+1 query problem and significantly improve the performance.

Additional Tips:

Eager loading can be used with multiple associations as well. For example: User.includes(:posts, :comments)
You can also chain query methods with eager loading. For example: User.includes(:posts).where(age: 18)
Be cautious of over-eager loading, where unnecessary associations are included, leading to larger result sets.
Only eager load the associations you actually need.
Use tools like bullet gem or query_analyzer gem to detect N+1 query problems in your codebase.
By applying eager loading, you can effectively mitigate the N+1 query problem and optimize the performance of 
your ActiveRecord queries.
It is a best practice to always consider eager loading when working with associations to minimize unnecessary database queries.

The N+1 query problem is a common scalability bottleneck in Rails applications. 
It involves fetching a list of resources from a database that includes other associated resources within them.
This means that we might have to query for the associated resources separately, leading to an inefficient and slow application. 
The solution to this problem is to use eager loading, which is the process of loading all the associated resources in a single query, 
instead of querying for each associated resource separately. Here are some ways to solve the N+1 query problem:

Use the includes method: This method is used to load the associated resources in a single query.
  It works by joining the associated tables and loading the associated resources along with the main resources.
Book.includes(:author).where(authors: { name: 'J.K. Rowling' })
This retrieves all records from the books table that have an author with the name 'J.K. Rowling' and loads 
the associated author records in a single query.




In summary, the N+1 query problem is a common scalability bottleneck in Rails applications.
The solution to this problem is to use eager loading,
which is the process of loading all the associated resources in a single query,
instead of querying for each associated resource separately.
This can be achieved using methods like includes,
