In Ruby on Rails, there are recommended naming conventions for controllers, models, views, and their respective folders. 

Adhering to these conventions makes it easier to understand and navigate your Rails application. 
Heres an explanation of the naming conventions along with code samples:

Controllers:

Controllers are plural and should be named using the plural form of the resource they handle. 
For example, if you have a resource called Student, the corresponding controller should be named StudentsController.
Controller filenames should be in snake_case with the suffix _controller.rb. 
For example, students_controller.rb.

# app/controllers/students_controller.rb
class StudentsController < ApplicationController
  # Controller code here
end









Models:

Models are singular and should be named using the singular form of the resource they represent.
For example, a model representing a student would be named Student.
Model filenames should be in snake_case. For example, student.rb.

# app/models/student.rb
class Student < ApplicationRecord
  # Model code here
end








Views:

View folders are plural and should match the pluralized controller name. 
For example, for the StudentsController, the view folder would be named students.
View files should match the name of the action or template they correspond to.
For example, index.html.erb, show.html.erb, edit.html.erb.
Partials, which are reusable sections of views, should be named with a leading underscore (_) followed by the name of the partial. 
For example, _student_info.html.erb.

<!-- app/views/students/index.html.erb -->
<h1>All Students</h1>
<!-- View code here -->
