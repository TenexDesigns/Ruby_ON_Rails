The `unless` keyword in Ruby is used as a conditional statement to execute a block of code when a specified condition is `false`. It is essentially the opposite of the `if` statement. In Rails, and Ruby in general, `unless` can be used in various contexts, including view templates, controller actions, and model methods.

Here's how `unless` is typically used in Ruby and Rails:

**1. In View Templates**:

You can use `unless` in view templates to conditionally render HTML or content based on a condition being `false`. For example, in an ERB template:

```erb
<% unless @user.admin? %>
  <p>You are not an admin.</p>
<% end %>
```

This code will display "You are not an admin." if the `@user` object's `admin?` method returns `false`.

**2. In Controller Actions**:

In Rails controllers, you can use `unless` to conditionally execute code based on a condition being `false`. For instance:

```ruby
def show
  @user = User.find(params[:id])
  unless @user.activated?
    flash[:alert] = "User is not activated."
    redirect_to root_url
  end
end
```

In this example, if `@user.activated?` returns `false`, the user will be redirected to the root URL with an alert message.

**3. In Model Methods**:

You can also use `unless` in model methods to specify when a certain condition is not met, a specific action should be taken. For example:

```ruby
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  def cancel_order
    unless shipped?
      update(status: 'canceled')
    end
  end
end
```

In this case, the `cancel_order` method will only update the order's status to 'canceled' if the order has not already been shipped.

The `unless` keyword provides a way to write conditional logic in a more readable and expressive manner when the desired action should occur when the condition is `false`. It is a useful tool for creating conditional branches in your Ruby and Rails code.
