Yes, it is true that the decorator pattern in Rails is often used to make a model slimmer. However, this is just a side effect of the pattern's primary purpose, which is to enhance an object's capability without extending the class. This can be useful for a variety of reasons, such as:

* To avoid cluttering the model with presentation logic.
* To make the model more modular and reusable.
* To allow for different ways of decorating the same object.
* To make the code more readable and maintainable.

The decorator pattern is implemented in Rails using the `active_decorator` gem. To use the pattern, you first need to install the gem and then generate a decorator for the model that you want to decorate.

Once you have generated a decorator, you can move any non-essential methods from the model to the decorator. For example, you might move presentation logic, such as formatting methods, to the decorator. You could also move methods that are specific to a particular use case, such as a method that generates a report, to the decorator.

Once you have moved the methods to the decorator, you can use the decorator to wrap the model instances that you want to decorate. For example, you could wrap the model instances in the decorator before passing them to a view.

Here is an example of how to use the decorator pattern in Rails:

```ruby
# Model
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :posts
end

# Decorator
module UserDecorator
  def name
    if last_name
      "#{first_name} #{last_name}"
    else
      first_name
    end
  end

  def profile_picture_url
    @profile_picture_url ||= begin
      hash = Digest::MD5.hexdigest(email)
      "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/#{hash}?d=wavatar"
    end
  end
end

# View
<% @users.each do |user| %>
  <%= user.name %>
  <%= user.profile_picture_url %>
<% end %>
```

In this example, the `UserDecorator` module defines two methods: `name` and `profile_picture_url`. These methods are used to decorate the `User` model instances before they are passed to the view.

The `name` method formats the user's name in a specific way. The `profile_picture_url` method generates a profile picture URL for the user.

The view then accesses the `name` and `profile_picture_url` methods on the `User` model instances. However, the `User` model instances are actually decorated with the `UserDecorator` module. This means that the `name` and `profile_picture_url` methods that are called are actually the methods defined in the `UserDecorator` module.

The decorator pattern can be used to decorate any object in Rails, not just models. For example, you could use the decorator pattern to decorate controllers, views, or even other decorators.

The decorator pattern is a powerful tool that can be used to improve the design and maintainability of your Rails code.
