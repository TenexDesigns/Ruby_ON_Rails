In a Rails application, you can pass data to the server using path parameters, parameters (also known as request parameters or request parameters), and query parameters. Each of these serves a distinct purpose and is used in different scenarios.

1. **Path Parameters**:
   - **What are they**: Path parameters are parts of the URL that represent data. They are often used to identify a specific resource or record in the application.
   - **How to use and send them**: Path parameters are typically included in the URL itself and are defined in the routes. You can define path parameters in your route using the `:param_name` syntax.
   - **How to receive and use them in Rails**:

   Example of sending path parameters from the client:

   ```bash
   GET /users/123
   ```

   In your routes file (routes.rb):

   ```ruby
   # Define a route with a path parameter
   get '/users/:id', to: 'users#show', as: 'user'
   ```

   In your controller:

   ```ruby
   class UsersController < ApplicationController
     def show
       # Access the path parameter using params[:id]
       user_id = params[:id]
       # Use the user_id to find and process data
     end
   end
   ```

2. **Parameters (Request Parameters)**:
   - **What are they**: Parameters are data sent to the server, typically as part of the request body. They can be used to send form data or JSON data to the server.
   - **How to use and send them**: Parameters are typically included in the request body. You can send parameters in a variety of ways, such as form submissions, JSON payloads, or URL-encoded data.
   - **How to receive and use them in Rails**:

   Example of sending parameters in a form submission:

   ```html
   <form action="/users" method="POST">
     <input type="text" name="user[name]" value="John">
     <input type="text" name="user[email]" value="john@example.com">
     <input type="submit" value="Submit">
   </form>
   ```

   In your controller:

   ```ruby
   class UsersController < ApplicationController
     def create
       # Access the parameters sent in the request body using params
       user_name = params[:user][:name]
       user_email = params[:user][:email]
       # Use the data to create a new user or perform other actions
     end
   end
   ```

3. **Query Parameters**:
   - **What are they**: Query parameters are additional data sent as part of the URL after a question mark (?). They are often used for filtering or pagination.
   - **How to use and send them**: Query parameters are included in the URL after a question mark, using the `key=value` format, and multiple parameters are separated by `&`.
   - **How to receive and use them in Rails**:

   Example of sending query parameters from the client:

   ```bash
   GET /articles?page=2&category=tech
   ```

   In your controller:

   ```ruby
   class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
     def index
       # Access query parameters using params
       page = params[:page]
       category = params[:category]
       # Use the data for filtering or pagination
     end
   end
   ```

In summary, path parameters are used for identifying resources in the URL, request parameters are sent in the request body, and query parameters are used for additional data in the URL. You can define routes and controllers in your Rails application to handle these parameters and use the data as needed for various functionalities.
