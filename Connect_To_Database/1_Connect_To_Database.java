To connect your Ruby on Rails application to a PostgreSQL database, you need to configure the database connection settings in the `config/database.yml` file. It appears that you've already provided the configuration settings for different environments (development, test, production) in your `database.yml` file. Here's an explanation of the configuration you've provided:

```yaml
default: &default
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  pool: <%= ENV.fetch("RAILS_MAX_THREADS") { 5 } %>
  host: localhost
  username: postgres
  password: GacauEliud
  port: 5433


development:
  <<: *default
  database: invoiced

test:
  <<: *default
  database: invoiced_test

production:
  <<: *default
  database: invoiced_production
  username: invoiced
  password: <%= ENV["INVOICED_DATABASE_PASSWORD"] %>
```  
  
```

In this configuration:

- `adapter`: Specifies the database adapter. You are using PostgreSQL, so it's set to `postgresql`.
- `encoding`: Defines the character encoding for the database, which is typically set to `unicode`.
- `pool`: Specifies the maximum number of database connections that can be created. The value is fetched from the `RAILS_MAX_THREADS` environment variable, with a default of 5.
- `host`: Specifies the database host. In your case, it's set to `localhost`.
- `username`: The PostgreSQL username to use when connecting. Here, it's set to `postgres`.
- `password`: The password for the PostgreSQL user. Make sure to store sensitive information like passwords in a secure way. It appears you've included your password directly in the file. Consider using environment variables to store sensitive information securely.
- `port`: Specifies the port number to connect to the database. The default PostgreSQL port is 5432, but in your case, you've set it to 5433.

For the different environments (`development`, `test`, `production`), you inherit these default settings and specify the respective database names:

```yaml
development:
  <<: *default
  database: invoiced

test:
  <<: *default
  database: invoiced_test

production:
  <<: *default
  database: invoiced_production
  username: invoiced
  password: <%= ENV["INVOICED_DATABASE_PASSWORD"] %>
```

In the production environment, it's common to use environment variables for sensitive information like database passwords to keep them secure. You can see that the production database password is retrieved from the `INVOICED_DATABASE_PASSWORD` environment variable.

In summary, you've correctly configured the database connection settings for PostgreSQL in your `config/database.yml` file for different environments. However, consider using environment variables to store sensitive information securely, and avoid storing sensitive information directly in your source code. Additionally, ensure that your PostgreSQL server is running and accessible at the specified host and port.

  # PostgreSQL. Versions 9.3 and up are supported.
#
# Install the pg driver:
#   gem install pg
# On macOS with Homebrew:
#   gem install pg -- --with-pg-config=/usr/local/bin/pg_config
# On macOS with MacPorts:
#   gem install pg -- --with-pg-config=/opt/local/lib/postgresql84/bin/pg_config
# On Windows:
#   gem install pg
#       Choose the win32 build.
#       Install PostgreSQL and put its /bin directory on your path.
#
# Configure Using Gemfile
# gem "pg"

default: &default
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  # For details on connection pooling, see Rails configuration guide
  # https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#database-pooling
  pool: <%= ENV.fetch("RAILS_MAX_THREADS") { 5 } %>
  host: localhost
  username: postgres
  password: GacauEliud
  port: 5433
  


development:
  <<: *default
  database: invoiced

  # The specified database role being used to connect to postgres.
  # To create additional roles in postgres see `$ createuser --help`.
  # When left blank, postgres will use the default role. This is
  # the same name as the operating system user running Rails.
  #username: invoiced

  # The password associated with the postgres role (username).
  #password:

  # Connect on a TCP socket. Omitted by default since the client uses a
  # domain socket that doesn't need configuration. Windows does not have
  # domain sockets, so uncomment these lines.
  #host: localhost

  # The TCP port the server listens on. Defaults to 5432.
  # If your server runs on a different port number, change accordingly.
  #port: 5432

  # Schema search path. The server defaults to $user,public
  #schema_search_path: myapp,sharedapp,public

  # Minimum log levels, in increasing order:
  #   debug5, debug4, debug3, debug2, debug1,
  #   log, notice, warning, error, fatal, and panic
  # Defaults to warning.
  #min_messages: notice

# Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run "rake".
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
test:
  <<: *default
  database: invoiced_test

# As with config/credentials.yml, you never want to store sensitive information,
# like your database password, in your source code. If your source code is
# ever seen by anyone, they now have access to your database.
#
# Instead, provide the password or a full connection URL as an environment
# variable when you boot the app. For example:
#
#   DATABASE_URL="postgres://myuser:mypass@localhost/somedatabase"
#
# If the connection URL is provided in the special DATABASE_URL environment
# variable, Rails will automatically merge its configuration values on top of
# the values provided in this file. Alternatively, you can specify a connection
# URL environment variable explicitly:
#
#   production:
#     url: <%= ENV["MY_APP_DATABASE_URL"] %>
#
# Read https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-a-database
# for a full overview on how database connection configuration can be specified.
#
production:
  <<: *default
  database: invoiced_production
  username: invoiced
  password: <%= ENV["INVOICED_DATABASE_PASSWORD"] %>
