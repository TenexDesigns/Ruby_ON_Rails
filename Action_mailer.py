Rails provides the ActionMailer component that enables applications to send and receive emails [7].
Here are the steps to send email using ActionMailer in Rails:

Generate a mailer using the rails generate mailer command:
rails generate mailer UserMailer
This will generate a user_mailer.rb file in the app/mailers directory, along with associated views and a test file.

Define a method in the mailer that sets up the email content:
class UserMailer < ApplicationMailer
  def welcome_email(user)
    @user = user
    @url  = 'http://example.com/login'
    mail(to: @user.email, subject: 'Welcome to My Awesome Site')
  end
end
In this example, were defining a welcome_email method that takes a user object as an argument 
and sets up the email content with instance variables @user and @url.
Were then calling the mail method to specify the recipient and subject of the email.

Create a view file for the email in the app/views/user_mailer directory:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta content='text/html; charset=UTF-8' http-equiv='Content-Type' />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to example.com, <%= @user.name %></h1>
    <p>
      You have successfully signed up to example.com,
      your username is: <%= @user.login %>.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      To login to the site, just follow this link: <%= @url %>.
    </p>
    <p>Thanks for joining and have a great day!</p>
  </body>
</html>
This view file defines the HTML content of the email and uses the instance variables @user and @url to
personalize the email for the recipient.

Call the mailer method from a controller action:
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def create
    @user = User.new(user_params)

    if @user.save
      UserMailer.welcome_email(@user).deliver_now
      redirect_to @user
    else
      render 'new'
    end
  end
end
In this example, were calling the welcome_email method from the UserMailer mailer and passing
in the @user object as an argument. Were then calling the deliver_now method to send the email immediately.

Here are some key points to keep in mind when sending email in Rails using ActionMailer:

The ActionMailer component allows you to send emails from your Rails application [7].
To use ActionMailer, generate a mailer using the rails generate mailer command [1] [7].
Define a method in the mailer that sets up the email content, and create a view file for the email in the app/views directory [1] [4].
Call the mailer method from a controller action to send the email [1] [4].
In summary, sending email in Rails using ActionMailer is a straightforward process.
Once you set up the mailer and define the email content and view, 
you can call the mailer method from a controller action to send the email.
