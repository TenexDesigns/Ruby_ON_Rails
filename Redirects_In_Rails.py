Redirecting in Rails is the process of sending the user to a different URL. 
This can be done for a variety of reasons, such as:

To prevent the user from accessing a page that they are not authorized to see.
To send the user to a page that is more appropriate for their current request.
To prevent the user from seeing an error message.
There are two main ways to redirect in Rails:

Using the redirect_to method in a controller action.
Using the "redirect" option in a route definition.
The "redirect_to" method takes a URL as its argument. 

The URL can be a string, a symbol, or a Proc. For example, the following code will redirect the user to the home page:

Code snippet
redirect_to root_path
Use code with caution. Learn more
The redirect option in a route definition takes a URL as its value.
The URL can be a string, a symbol, or a Proc.
For example, the following route definition will redirect the user to the home page if they are not logged in:

Code snippet
get "/products/:id", to: redirect("/products/index") if !current_user
Use code with caution. Learn more
By default, Rails will use a 302 Found redirect when you use the redirect_to method or the redirect option in 
a route definition. However, you can also specify a different status code by passing it as the second argument
to the redirect_to method. For example, the following code will redirect the user to the home page 
with a 301 Moved Permanently status code:

Code snippet
redirect_to root_path, status: 301
Use code with caution. Learn more
Here are some additional tips for redirecting in Rails:

You can use the flash object to pass a message to the user when you redirect them. 
For example, the following code will redirect the user to the home page and flash a message telling them that they need to log in:
Code snippet
flash[:notice] = "You need to log in."
redirect_to root_path
Use code with caution. Learn more


You can use the redirect_back method to redirect the user to the previous page that they were on.
For example, the following code will redirect the user to the previous page that they were on if they are not logged in:
Code snippet
redirect_back(fallback_location: root_path) if !current_user
Use code with caution. Learn more
You can use the redirect_to_unless method to redirect the user to a different URL unless a certain condition is met.
For example, the following code will redirect the user to the home page if they are not logged in,
but will not redirect them if they are logged in:
Code snippet
redirect_to_unless current_user, root_path

In Ruby on Rails, you can use the redirect_to method to set up redirects, which tells the browser to send a new request
for a different URL [5]. Here are some additional details on redirects in Rails based on the search results:

By default, Rails protects against open redirects to external hosts for your applications safety. 
If you want to allow external redirects, you can pass allow_other_host: true to redirect_to,
but note that using a user-provided parameter in that case is unsafe [1].

The redirect_back method returns the user to the page they just came from. If the HTTP_REFERER header is not set,
you can provide a fallback location [10].
Rails 5 improves the redirect_to :back method to avoid exceptions when the previous URL is not present,
  and you can redirect to the root URL in that case [9].
  
When using redirect_to, you can specify a response status code as an optional parameter [4].
If youre not careful with what you provide to redirect_to, you may expose yourself to an open redirect vulnerability [11].

When using Turbo Rails, clicking an a link with data-turbo-method: delete issues a DELETE request to the server 
  and may result in a redirect using redirect_to [12].
  
In summary, you can use redirect_to to set up redirects in Rails, and you can specify a response status code
or use redirect_back to redirect to the previous URL. Rails protects against open redirects by default,
and you need to be careful with what you provide to redirect_to to avoid exposing yourself to vulnerabilities.

In Ruby on Rails, redirects are commonly used to send an HTTP redirect response to the client, 
instructing the browser to navigate to a different URL. There are several ways to implement redirects in Rails:

Redirecting to a Named Route:
You can use named routes to redirect to a specific route within your application.
This is often done in controller actions. Here's an example:


redirect_to root_path
In the above code, root_path is a named route that corresponds to the root URL of your application.

Redirecting to a URL or Path:
You can redirect to a specific URL or path using the redirect_to method. Here's an example:


redirect_to "https://example.com"
This will redirect the user to an external URL.

Redirecting with Flash Messages:
Flash messages are temporary messages that can be displayed after a redirect.
They are often used to provide feedback to the user. Here's an example:


redirect_to users_path, notice: "User created successfully!"
In this case, the user will be redirected to the users_path (a named route) with a success notice.

Conditional Redirects:
You can conditionally redirect based on certain conditions. Here's an example:


if some_condition
  redirect_to root_path
else
  redirect_to login_path
end
This code will redirect the user to the root path if some_condition is true; otherwise, it will redirect to the login path.

These are some common ways to implement redirects in Ruby on Rails. 
Redirects are commonly used after form submissions, successful operations, or when certain conditions are met. 
Choose the appropriate method based on your specific requirements and the desired destination for the redirect.
