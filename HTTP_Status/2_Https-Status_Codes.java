HTTP status codes are a standard part of HTTP responses, indicating whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed. In Rails, these status codes can be represented by symbols for more human-readable code. Here's the meaning and usage of the HTTP status codes you mentioned:

1. **Informational Status Codes (1xx)**: These codes indicate that the request was received and is being processed. They are less commonly used in Rails applications, but here's what they mean:
    - `:continue` (100): The client should continue with its request. This interim response is used to inform the client that the initial part of the request has been received and has not yet been rejected by the server.
    - `:switching_protocols` (101): The server understands and is willing to comply with the client's request, via the Upgrade header field, for a change in the application protocol being used on this connection.
    - `:processing` (102): A WebDAV specific code that indicates that the server has received and is processing the request, but no response is available yet.
    - `:early_hints` (103): Used to return some response headers before the final HTTP message.

2. **Successful Status Codes (2xx)**: These codes indicate that the client's request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.
    - `:ok` (200): The request has succeeded.
    - `:created` (201): The request has been fulfilled and has resulted in one or more new resources being created.
    - `:accepted` (202): The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed.
    - `:non_authoritative_information` (203): The returned meta-information in the entity-header is not the definitive set as available from the origin server.
    - `:no_content` (204): The server has fulfilled the request but does not need to return an entity-body, and might want to return updated meta-information.
    - `:reset_content` (205): The server has fulfilled the request and the user agent should reset the document view which caused the request to be sent.
    - `:partial_content` (206): The server has fulfilled the partial GET request for the resource.
    - `:multi_status` (207): Provides status for multiple independent operations.
    - `:already_reported` (208): Used inside a DAV: propstat response element to avoid enumerating the internal members of multiple bindings to the same collection repeatedly.
    - `:im_used` (226): The server has fulfilled a GET request for the resource, and the response is a representation of the result of one or more instance-manipulations applied to the current instance.

3. **Redirection Status Codes (3xx)**: These codes indicate that further action needs to be taken by the user agent to fulfill the request.
    - `:multiple_choices` (300): The requested resource corresponds to any one of a set of representations, each with its own specific location.
    - `:moved_permanently` (301): The requested resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any future references to this resource should use one of the returned URIs.
    - `:found` (302): The requested resource resides temporarily under a different URI.
    - `:see_other` (303): The response to the request can be found under a different URI and should be retrieved using a GET method on that resource.
    - `:not_modified` (304): If the client has performed a conditional GET request and access is allowed, but the document has not been modified, the server should respond with this status code.
    - `:use_proxy` (305): The requested resource must be accessed through the proxy given by the Location field.
    - `:reserved` (306): No longer used. Originally meant "Subsequent requests should use the specified proxy."
    - `:temporary_redirect` (307): The requested resource resides temporarily under a different URI.
    - `:permanent_redirect` (308): The target resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any future references to this resource ought to use one of the enclosed URIs.

4. **Client Error Status Codes (4xx)**: These codes are intended for situations in which the error seems to have been caused by the client.
    - `:bad_request` (400): The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax.
    - `:unauthorized` (401): The request requires user authentication.
    - `:payment_required` (402): This code is reserved for future use.
    - `:forbidden` (403): The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it.
    - `:not_found` (404): The server has not found anything matching the Request-URI.
    - `:method_not_allowed` (405): The method specified in the Request-Line is not allowed for the resource identified by the Request-URI.
