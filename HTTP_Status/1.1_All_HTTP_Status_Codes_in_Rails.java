In Ruby on Rails, these HTTP status codes and symbols are used to represent the response status of an HTTP request. They are part of the Rails framework's HTTP status code constants and are often used when responding to HTTP requests in your application. Here's a breakdown of the status codes, their corresponding symbols, their meanings, and when to use them:

**Informational (1xx)**:
1. `100 :continue` - Continue: This status indicates that the initial part of the request has been received, and the client should continue with the request.

2. `101 :switching_protocols` - Switching Protocols: It informs the client that the server is changing protocols.

3. `102 :processing` - Processing: The server is still processing the request but hasn't completed it yet.

4. `103 :early_hints` - Early Hints: This is an informational status code that can be used to send preliminary response headers before the final response.

**Success (2xx)**:
1. `200 :ok` - Ok: The request was successful, and the server is returning the requested data.

2. `201 :created` - Created: The request has been fulfilled, and a new resource has been created.

3. `202 :accepted` - Accepted: The request has been accepted for processing but may not be completed yet.

4. `203 :non_authoritative_information` - Non-Authoritative Information: The server is a proxy, and the response is from a source that is not the original server.

5. `204 :no_content` - No Content: The request was successful, but there is no content to return.

6. `205 :reset_content` - Reset Content: Informs the client to reset the document view.

7. `206 :partial_content` - Partial Content: Used for requests that result in partial success, typically for range requests.

8. `207 :multi_status` - Multi Status: This status code is not typically used in web applications.

9. `208 :already_reported` - Already Reported: Similar to 207, it's not commonly used in web applications.

10. `226 :im_used` - IM Used: This status is reserved for future use.

**Redirection (3xx)**:
1. `300 :multiple_choices` - Multiple Choices: The request has multiple possible responses, and the client should choose one.

2. `301 :moved_permanently` - Moved Permanently: The resource has been permanently moved to a different URL.

3. `302 :found` - Found: The resource is temporarily located at a different URL. This is often used for temporary redirects.

4. `303 :see_other` - See Other: Similar to 302, indicating that the client should look for the resource at a different URL.

5. `304 :not_modified` - Not Modified: The client's cached copy is still valid, and there's no need to transfer data again.

6. `307 :temporary_redirect` - Temporary Redirect: The request should be repeated with another URI, but the client should continue to use the original URI for future requests.

7. `308 :permanent_redirect` - Permanent Redirect: Similar to 301, indicating that the resource has been permanently moved.

The above status codes are used to communicate the result of an HTTP request, and they help browsers and clients understand how to handle the response. You would typically use them in Rails when responding to requests in your controllers, indicating the outcome of the requested action.



In Ruby on Rails, the HTTP status codes and symbols you've listed are used to represent various client errors and server errors. Here's a breakdown of these status codes, their corresponding symbols, their meanings, and when to use them:

**Client Error (4xx)**:
1. `400 :bad_request` - Bad Request: This status code is used when the server cannot understand or process the client's request due to invalid syntax or other client-side errors. It is often used when there's a problem with the request itself.

2. `401 :unauthorized` - Unauthorized: Indicates that the client's request requires authentication or lacks valid authentication credentials. It's used when access to a resource is restricted.

3. `402 :payment_required` - Payment Required: This status is not commonly used in web applications and is reserved for future use.

4. `403 :forbidden` - Forbidden: Indicates that the server understood the request but refuses to fulfill it, typically due to insufficient permissions or access restrictions.

5. `404 :not_found` - Not Found: Used when the requested resource does not exist on the server. This is a common status code for handling non-existent routes or resources.

6. `405 :method_not_allowed` - Method Not Allowed: Indicates that the request method (e.g., GET, POST, PUT) is not allowed for the requested resource.

7. `406 :not_acceptable` - Not Acceptable: This status code is used when the server cannot provide the response in the format requested by the client.

8. `407 :proxy_authentication_required` - Proxy Authentication Required: Similar to 401, but the client needs to authenticate with a proxy server.

9. `408 :request_timeout` - Request Timeout: Used when the server times out while waiting for the client's request. It's a way to inform the client that the server couldn't process the request in time.

10. `409 :conflict` - Conflict: Indicates that the request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the target resource. It's often used in scenarios involving concurrent updates.

11. `410 :gone` - Gone: Used when a resource was previously available but has been intentionally removed or is no longer reachable.

12. `411 :length_required` - Length Required: The server requires the client to include a Content-Length header in the request.

13. `412 :precondition_failed` - Precondition Failed: This status is used when one or more conditions specified in the request headers are not met.

14. `413 :request_entity_too_large` - Request Entity Too Large: Indicates that the request payload (e.g., request body) is too large for the server to process.

15. `414 :request_uri_too_long` - Request URI Too Long: Used when the request URI (e.g., URL) is too long for the server to process.

16. `415 :unsupported_media_type` - Unsupported Media Type: The server cannot process the request because the media type or format of the request is not supported.

17. `416 :requested_range_not_satisfiable` - Requested Range Not Satisfiable: This status is used in response to range requests (e.g., for downloading parts of a file) when the requested range is invalid.

18. `417 :expectation_failed` - Expectation Failed: Indicates that the server cannot meet the requirements specified in the "Expect" request header field.

19. `421 :misdirected_request` - Misdirected Request: Used when the server is not able to produce a response because of a request that was intended for a different resource.

20. `422 :unprocessable_entity` - Unprocessable Entity: Typically used in the context of web applications to indicate that the server understands the request but cannot process it due to semantic errors.

21. `423 :locked` - Locked: Indicates that the requested resource is locked and cannot be accessed.

22. `424 :failed_dependency` - Failed Dependency: Used to indicate that the request failed because it relies on another request that failed.

23. `425 :too_early` - Too Early: This status code is not commonly used in web applications and is reserved for future use.

24. `426 :upgrade_required` - Upgrade Required: The server requires the client to switch to a different protocol, typically for security reasons.

25. `428 :precondition_required` - Precondition Required: Similar to 412, used to indicate that a precondition specified in the request headers was not met.

26. `429 :too_many_requests` - Too Many Requests: Indicates that the client has sent too many requests in a given amount of time, and it should wait before sending more.

27. `431 :request_header_fields_too_large` - Request Header Fields Too Large: Used when the server refuses to process the request because the headers are too large.

28. `451 :unavailable_for_legal_reasons` - Unavailable for Legal Reasons: Indicates that the resource is unavailable for legal reasons, such as censorship or government-imposed restrictions.

**Server Error (5xx)**:
1. `500 :internal_server_error` - Internal Server Error: This is a generic server error indicating that something has gone wrong on the server, and it couldn't fulfill the request.

2. `501 :not_implemented` - Not Implemented: Used to indicate that the server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request.

3. `502 :bad_gateway` - Bad Gateway: Typically used when a server acting as a gateway or proxy received an invalid response from an upstream server.

4. `503 :service_unavailable` - Service Unavailable: The server is temporarily unable to handle the request due to being overloaded or undergoing maintenance.

5. `504 :gateway_timeout` - Gateway Timeout: Indicates that an upstream server did not respond within a reasonable time frame.

6. `505 :http_version_not_supported` - HTTP Version Not Supported: Used to indicate that the server does not support the HTTP protocol version used in the request.

7. `506 :variant_also_negotiates` - Variant Also Negotiates: This status code is not commonly used in web applications.

8. `507 :insufficient_storage` - Insufficient Storage: Used in the context of web applications to indicate that the server is unable to store the representation needed to complete the request.

9. `508 :loop_detected` - Loop Detected: Indicates that the server has detected an infinite loop while processing the request.

10. `509 :bandwidth_limit_exceeded` - Bandwidth Limit Exceeded: This status code is not commonly used in web applications and is reserved for future use.

12. `511 :network_authentication_required` - Network Authentication Required: Indicates that the client needs to authenticate to access the network.

You would use these status codes and symbols in your Ruby on Rails application to provide appropriate responses to client requests. For example, you might return a `404 :not_found` status when a requested resource is missing, or a `403 :forbidden` status when a user attempts to access a resource without the necessary permissions. Similarly, server errors like `500 :internal_server_error` indicate a problem on the server that prevents it from handling the request correctly.
