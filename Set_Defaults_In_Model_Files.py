In the given code snippet, we have a Rails model called Project that inherits from ApplicationRecord. 
This model demonstrates how to set defaults for attributes using an after_initialize callback.

ruby
Copy code
class Project < ApplicationRecord
  after_initialize :set_defaults

  def set_defaults
    self.percent_complete ||= 0.0
  end
end
The after_initialize callback is triggered automatically after a new instance of the Project model is initialized.
It allows you to perform custom logic or set default values for attributes.

In this example, the set_defaults method is defined to set a default value for the percent_complete attribute. 
The line self.percent_complete ||= 0.0 assigns a default value of 0.0 to percent_complete if it is nil or not already assigned.

This ensures that whenever a new Project object is created, the percent_complete attribute will have a default 
value of 0.0 unless explicitly specified otherwise.

By using the after_initialize callback and defining the set_defaults method, you can customize the initialization process
of your model instances and establish default values for attributes. 
This approach helps ensure consistency and provides predictable behavior when creating new instances of the Project model.

Sure. The code below is a model file for a Project model
. It defines a default value for the percent_complete attribute using the after_initialize callback:

Ruby
class Project < ApplicationRecord
  after_initialize :set_defaults

  def set_defaults
    self.percent_complete ||= 0.0
  end
end

The after_initialize callback is called after a new record is created. 
In this case, we are using the after_initialize callback to set the percent_complete attribute to 0.0 if it is not already set.

This is useful because it ensures that every project has a percent_complete attribute,
even if it is not set by the user. This can be helpful for tracking the progress of projects.

In the context of model files and setting defaults in Rails, the code above shows how to use 
the after_initialize callback to set a default value for an attribute.

*******************************************************************************************************************************
The code you provided sets a default value for the percent_complete attribute in the Project model using the
after_initialize callback and a custom setter method:

class Project < ApplicationRecord
  after_initialize :set_defaults

  def set_defaults
    self.percent_complete ||= 0.0
  end
end
In this example, the after_initialize callback is used to call the set_defaults method after the object is initialized.
The set_defaults method uses the ||= operator to set the default value for the percent_complete attribute only if it is nil.
This approach ensures that the default value is set only when the attribute is not already set,
avoiding potential issues with overriding existing values.

This technique is useful for setting default values for attributes in Rails model files and is considered
a best practice because it keeps the code clean and maintainable, as well as ensuring that default values are set only when necessary
