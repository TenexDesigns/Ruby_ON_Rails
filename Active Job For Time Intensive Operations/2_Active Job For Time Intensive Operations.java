Active Job is a Ruby on Rails framework for performing asynchronous jobs. It allows you to queue jobs to be run in the background, which can be useful for time-intensive operations that you don't want to block your web application users.

To use Active Job for time-intensive operations, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a job class that inherits from `ActiveJob::Base`.
2. Define the job logic in the `perform` method.
3. Queue the job to be run in the background using the `queue` method.
4. Start a worker process to process the queued jobs.

Here is an example of a simple Active Job class for sending an email:

```ruby
class SendEmailJob < ActiveJob::Base
  queue_as :default

  def perform(email_address, subject, body)
    # Send the email
  end
end
```

To queue this job to be run in the background, you can use the following code:

```ruby
SendEmailJob.perform_later(email_address, subject, body)
```

This will add the job to the `default` queue. You can also create other queues for different types of jobs, such as a `high_priority` queue for jobs that need to be run as soon as possible.

To start a worker process to process the queued jobs, you can use the following command:

```
rails jobs:work
```

This will start a worker process that will listen for jobs in the queue and run them in the background.

You can also use Active Job to perform time-intensive operations that are triggered by user actions. For example, when a user submits a form, you can queue a job to process the form data and send an email notification. This will allow the user to continue using the web application while the job is running in the background.

Active Job is a powerful tool for performing time-intensive operations in Rails applications. It can help you to improve the performance and responsiveness of your applications.
