Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice where developers frequently integrate code changes into a shared repository. With CI, automated tests are run on the integrated code to catch bugs and issues early in the development process. CI tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, and CircleCI help streamline this process by automating the building, testing, and deployment of your application.

Here's how to use CI tools like Travis CI and CircleCI with Ruby on Rails, along with some code samples:

### Travis CI:

1. **Signup for Travis CI**: Visit the [Travis CI website](https://travis-ci.com/) and sign up using your GitHub account.

2. **Create a `.travis.yml` File**: In your Rails project's root directory, create a `.travis.yml` file. This file configures how Travis CI builds and tests your application. Here's a basic example:

```yaml
language: ruby
rvm:
  - 2.7.4 # Specify your desired Ruby version
before_script:
  - bundle install
script:
  - bundle exec rspec # Run your RSpec tests
```

3. **Push to GitHub**: Commit the `.travis.yml` file to your GitHub repository.

4. **Enable Your Repository on Travis CI**: On the Travis CI website, go to your profile, find your repository, and enable it for CI.

Travis CI will now automatically build and test your Rails application whenever you push changes to your GitHub repository.

### CircleCI:

1. **Signup for CircleCI**: Visit the [CircleCI website](https://circleci.com/) and sign up using your GitHub account.

2. **Create a `.circleci/config.yml` File**: In your Rails projects root directory, create a `.circleci/config.yml` file. This file defines the build and test configuration. Here's a basic example:

```yaml
version: 2.1
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/ruby:2.7.4 # Specify your desired Ruby version
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Install Dependencies
          command: bundle install
      - run:
          name: Run Tests
          command: bundle exec rspec # Run your RSpec tests
```

3. **Push to GitHub**: Commit the `.circleci` directory and the `config.yml` file to your GitHub repository.

4. **Enable Your Repository on CircleCI**: On the CircleCI website, go to your projects, find your repository, and enable it for CI.

CircleCI will now automatically build and test your Rails application whenever you push changes to your GitHub repository.

Both Travis CI and CircleCI offer extensive documentation to help you configure more advanced build and deployment workflows. These tools can also be configured to deploy your application to various hosting services or cloud platforms once your tests pass.

By integrating CI into your Rails project, you ensure that code changes are continuously validated, which helps maintain code quality and ensures that your application is always in a deployable state.
