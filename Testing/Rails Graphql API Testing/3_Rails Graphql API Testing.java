Testing in Rails API with GraphQL is the process of verifying that your API is working as expected. This includes testing the following:

* **Schema:** The schema is the definition of your API's data types and relationships. It is important to test that the schema is correct and complete.
* **Queries and mutations:** Queries and mutations are the operations that users can perform on your API. It is important to test that queries and mutations are working as expected and returning the correct results.
* **Authentication and authorization:** If your API uses authentication and authorization, it is important to test that these features are working as expected.
* **Performance:** It is important to test the performance of your API to make sure that it can handle the expected load.

**How to do testing:**

There are a number of different ways to test a Rails API with GraphQL. One popular approach is to use a testing framework such as RSpec or Minitest. These frameworks provide a number of tools that make it easy to write and execute tests.

Another approach to testing is to use a GraphQL client library such as Apollo Client or Relay. These libraries provide a number of features that make it easy to test GraphQL queries and mutations.

**What to test:**

When testing a Rails API with GraphQL, it is important to test the following:

* **All of the endpoints in your API:** Make sure that all of the endpoints in your API are returning the correct results.
* **All of the different ways that your API can be used:** For example, if your API allows users to create, read, update, and delete data, make sure that all of these operations are working as expected.
* **All of the different types of errors that your API can generate:** Make sure that your API is handling errors correctly and returning the appropriate error messages.

**When to test:**

It is important to test your Rails API with GraphQL throughout the development process. You should test your API whenever you make changes to the code, and you should also test your API regularly as part of your continuous integration pipeline.

**What to use to test:**

There are a number of different tools and frameworks that can be used to test a Rails API with GraphQL. Some popular options include:

* **RSpec:** RSpec is a popular testing framework for Ruby. It provides a number of features that make it easy to write and execute tests.
* **Minitest:** Minitest is another popular testing framework for Ruby. It is a lightweight framework that is easy to use.
* **Apollo Client:** Apollo Client is a GraphQL client library that provides a number of features for testing GraphQL queries and mutations.
* **Relay:** Relay is another GraphQL client library that provides a number of features for testing GraphQL queries and mutations.

**How and when to test:**

The specific way you test your Rails API with GraphQL will depend on the tools and frameworks that you are using. However, there are some general guidelines that you can follow:

* **Start by writing unit tests for your individual GraphQL queries and mutations.** This will help you to verify that each query and mutation is working as expected.
* **Once you have written unit tests for your individual queries and mutations, you can write integration tests to verify that your API is working as a whole.** This will involve testing the different ways that your API can be used and the different types of errors that your API can generate.
* **You should test your API regularly as part of your continuous integration pipeline.** This will help you to catch any errors early on in the development process.

**Code samples:**

Here is an example of a unit test for a GraphQL query in RSpec:

```ruby
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe MyQuery, type: :query do
  it 'returns all of the articles' do
    articles = create_list(:article, 10)

    query = <<~QUERY
      query {
        articles {
          title
        }
      }
    QUERY

    result = graphql_query(query)

    expect(result['data']['articles'].count).to eq(10)
    expect(result['data']['articles'].map { |article| article['title'] }).to eq(articles.map(&:title))
  end
end
```

This test will verify that the `MyQuery` query returns all of the articles in the database.

Here is an example of an integration test for a GraphQL mutation in RSpec:

```ruby
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe MyMutation, type: :mutation do
  it 'creates a new article
