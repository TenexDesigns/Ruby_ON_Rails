Integrating advanced callbacks in Rails can be challenging due to the complexity and the potential for creating tightly coupled code. 
To maintain a clean and maintainable codebase, it's essential to follow best practices when using callbacks in Rails.

Asynchronous by default: Avoid keeping the user waiting while your callbacks perform their tasks. 
  Make callbacks asynchronous unless they need to be part of the transaction medium.com.
Prefer after_commit to after_save: Ensure that the transaction is actually committed before passing information to another model.
  Use after_commit for actions like sending welcome emails to new users, unless you want to track changes
  in an object's attributes, such as with a method like user.phone_changed? medium.com.
  
Use service objects or POROs (Plain Old Ruby Objects): Instead of relying solely on callbacks,
  consider refactoring complex callback logic into service objects or POROs.
  This approach makes the code more modular, testable, and easier to maintain medium.com.
  
  
Keep callbacks organized: To avoid callback-related issues during debugging or refactoring, 
  
  create a callback card for each object state, which includes information about the state changes and relevant callbacks. 
  This practice helps streamline the process of tracking down issues related to callbacks medium.com.
Refer to the Rails Callbacks Cheat Sheet: The Rails Callbacks Cheat Sheet is a useful resource that provides a
  quick reference for all current Rails 5 Active Record callbacks, helping you understand when and how to use 
  them effectively juliannaseiki.medium.com.
By following these best practices, you can effectively integrate advanced callbacks in Rails while maintaining
a clean and maintainable codebase.
