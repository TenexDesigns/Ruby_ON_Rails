Whether companies like GitHub and Shopify use a monolith or microservices architecture depends on the specific needs of their applications.

**GitHub** uses a microservices architecture for its backend. This architecture allows GitHub to scale its backend horizontally and to independently deploy and update different parts of the system. GitHub also uses a number of different technologies for its backend, including Ruby, Python, and Go.

**Shopify** uses a hybrid architecture for its backend. This architecture combines elements of both monoliths and microservices. Shopify's backend is divided into a number of different services, but some of these services are still tightly coupled. Shopify also uses a number of different technologies for its backend, including Ruby, Python, and Java.

** Approaches to developing backends with Rails to serve a lot of users and offer users the features and resources they need:**

Here are some approaches to developing backends with Rails to serve a lot of users and offer users the features and resources they need:

* **Use a microservices architecture:** Microservices can be a good choice for Rails applications that need to be scalable and resilient. Microservices can be scaled independently and can continue to operate even if one microservice fails.
* **Use a hybrid architecture:** A hybrid architecture can be a good choice for Rails applications that need to be both scalable and efficient. A hybrid architecture combines elements of both monoliths and microservices.
* **Use a caching layer:** A caching layer can help to improve the performance of Rails applications by storing frequently accessed data in memory.
* **Use a load balancer:** A load balancer can distribute traffic across multiple Rails servers, which can improve the scalability and reliability of the application.
* **Use a content delivery network (CDN):** A CDN can deliver static content, such as images and CSS files, to users from servers that are located close to them. This can improve the performance of the application and reduce the load on the Rails servers.

The best approach to developing backends with Rails will depend on the specific needs of the application. There is no one-size-fits-all approach.

In addition to the above approaches, here are some other tips for developing Rails applications that can serve a lot of users and offer users the features and resources they need:

* **Use a database that can handle high traffic:** Rails applications typically use PostgreSQL or MySQL as the database. Both of these databases can handle high traffic loads.
* **Use a scalable hosting provider:** Rails applications can be hosted on a variety of different providers, such as Heroku, AWS, and Azure. Choose a hosting provider that can scale to meet the needs of your application.
* **Monitor your application:** Monitor the performance and reliability of your application to identify any potential problems early on.

By following these tips, you can develop Rails applications that can serve a lot of users and offer users the features and resources they need.
