Based on the search results, it is difficult to determine the exact backend architecture used by GitHub and Shopify. However, here are some insights that can help us understand their approach to backend development:

- GitHub: The search results did not provide specific information about the backend architecture used by GitHub. However, GitHub is a large-scale platform with millions of users and repositories, so it is likely that they employ a combination of monolithic and microservices architectures to handle the diverse functionality and scalability requirements of their platform.

- Shopify: Shopify is known to have started as a monolithic architecture, where the entire application was built as a single codebase. However, as the platform grew, Shopify adopted a more modular approach, transitioning to a microservices architecture[^4^]. This allowed them to scale different components of their system independently and introduce new features more easily.

It's important to note that both monolithic and microservices architectures have their own advantages and trade-offs. The choice of architecture depends on various factors, including the complexity of the application, scalability requirements, development team size, and the need for independent deployment of services.

When developing backends with Rails to serve a large number of users and offer user features and resources, here are some general best practices:

1. Use Caching: Implement caching mechanisms to reduce database queries and improve response times. Rails provides built-in support for caching with features like fragment caching and low-level caching[^10^].

2. Optimize Database Queries: Utilize database query optimization techniques such as eager loading, indexing, and using the correct associations to minimize the number of database queries[^11^].

3. Implement Background Jobs: Offload time-consuming tasks to background jobs using tools like Sidekiq or Active Job to improve the responsiveness of the application[^12^].

4. Scale Horizontally: Consider scaling horizontally by adding more servers or using cloud-based infrastructure to distribute the load and handle increased traffic[^13^].

5. Monitor Performance: Set up monitoring tools to track system performance and identify bottlenecks. Tools like New Relic and Scout can help identify performance issues and optimize the application[^14^][^15^].

6. Use Content Delivery Networks (CDNs): Utilize CDNs to cache static assets and serve them from edge locations closer to the users, reducing latency and improving performance[^16^].

7. Implement Load Balancing: Use load balancers to distribute incoming requests across multiple server instances, ensuring optimal resource utilization and high availability[^17^].

These are just a few general approaches to consider when developing backends with Rails to serve a large number of users and offer user features and resources. The specific implementation details may vary depending on the requirements and constraints of your application.
