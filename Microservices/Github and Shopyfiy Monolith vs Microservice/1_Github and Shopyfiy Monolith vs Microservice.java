Both GitHub and Shopify have complex and large-scale applications built with Ruby on Rails. While the specific architectural choices they make may not be publicly disclosed in great detail, we can make some educated assumptions based on the general principles of scalability and their needs. Keep in mind that these assumptions may not reflect their exact architectural setup:

1. GitHub:
   - GitHub is known for its large user base and the need to handle a high volume of concurrent requests.
   - GitHub likely employs a combination of architectural strategies. While the core of their application may be built using monolithic Rails components, they likely use microservices for certain functionalities.
   - They may adopt a hybrid approach, with the monolith handling core features and certain functions distributed as microservices.
   - Some parts of GitHub could be containerized using technologies like Docker and orchestrated with Kubernetes.

2. Shopify:
   - Shopify is a large e-commerce platform with thousands of online stores and significant scalability requirements.
   - Shopify is known for using a monolithic Rails application. However, they have also adopted microservices for specific components.
   - They've open-sourced some of their projects related to microservices and scalability, such as "Ejson" and "Shipit."
   - Shopify may use various technologies and approaches to scale and manage their monolithic Rails application.

When developing backend systems in Rails to serve a large number of users and provide the necessary features and resources, companies often employ the following approaches:

1. Monolithic Architecture:
   - Many companies start with a monolithic Rails application, which is a simple and straightforward way to build and deploy web applications.
   - Monolithic applications can be a good choice for smaller to medium-sized applications where complexity is manageable.
   - As the application grows, it's common to encounter scalability challenges, which may lead to the adoption of microservices.

2. Microservices:
   - Microservices architecture involves breaking down the application into smaller, independently deployable services.
   - This approach is useful when different components of the application require different scalability, maintainability, or technology stacks.
   - Microservices offer flexibility but come with complexity in terms of orchestration, communication, and data consistency.

3. Hybrid Approach:
   - Many companies use a hybrid approach, combining monolithic and microservices architectures.
   - Core features may remain within the monolith, while certain components that require independent scaling or technology choices are implemented as microservices.

The choice between monolithic and microservices architecture depends on factors like the application's size, complexity, growth rate, and the team's expertise. It's essential to carefully evaluate the specific needs of the application and choose the most suitable architecture accordingly.
