Yes, there are a number of platforms that can offer you the ability to deploy microservices, Kubernetes, and databases for free on a small scale. This is a great way for students and hobbyists to learn and experiment with these technologies without having to pay for expensive production-grade infrastructure.

Here are a few options to consider:

* **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**: GKE offers a free tier that includes 1 cluster with up to 3 nodes. This is enough to run a small-scale microservices application.
* **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)**: EKS also offers a free tier that includes 1 cluster with up to 3 nodes.
* **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**: AKS also offers a free tier that includes 1 cluster with up to 3 nodes.
* **Minikube:** Minikube is a lightweight Kubernetes implementation that can run on your local machine. This is a good option for experimenting with Kubernetes if you don't need a production-grade cluster.

For databases, you can use a managed database service like Cloud SQL, Amazon RDS, or Azure SQL Database. These services offer free tiers that are sufficient for small-scale applications.

To deploy your microservices to Kubernetes, you can use a tool like Helm. Helm makes it easy to package and deploy your microservices to Kubernetes clusters.

Once your microservices are deployed to Kubernetes, you can make them accessible on the web by using a load balancer. You can use a managed load balancer service like Cloud Load Balancing, Amazon ELB, or Azure Load Balancer, or you can set up your own load balancer using a tool like Nginx or HAProxy.

Here is an example of how you could deploy a microservices application to Kubernetes for free:

1. Create a Kubernetes cluster on GKE, EKS, or AKS using the free tier.
2. Deploy your microservices to the Kubernetes cluster using Helm.
3. Create a load balancer to make your microservices accessible on the web.

This is just a basic example, and there are many other ways to deploy microservices to Kubernetes for free. For more information, please refer to the documentation for the platform that you are using.
