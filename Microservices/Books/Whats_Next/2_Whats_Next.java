**Next steps after learning GraphQL with Rails authentication and authorization:**

**Construct microservices with GraphQL APIs:**

To construct microservices with GraphQL APIs, you can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the different domains of your application.** Each microservice should be responsible for a single domain, such as users, orders, or products.
2. **Design the GraphQL schema for each microservice.** The schema should define the types of data that the microservice exposes and the queries and mutations that clients can use to interact with that data.
3. **Implement the resolvers for each type in the schema.** Resolvers are responsible for fetching and manipulating the data for each type.
4. **Deploy each microservice to its own server.** You can use a platform like Docker or Kubernetes to manage your microservices.

**Make production-grade backend with Rails and GraphQL:**

To make a production-grade backend with Rails and GraphQL, you need to consider the following:

* **Scalability:** Your backend needs to be able to handle a large number of concurrent requests. You can use features like caching and load balancing to improve scalability.
* **Reliability:** Your backend needs to be reliable and available even when there are errors. You can use features like database replication and monitoring to improve reliability.
* **Security:** Your backend needs to be secure from attack. You can use features like authentication, authorization, and encryption to protect your data.

**Learn deployment of microservices with Rails and GraphQL on different platforms:**

There are many different platforms that you can use to deploy microservices with Rails and GraphQL. Some popular options include:

* **Docker:** Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to package your microservices into containers that can be run on any machine.
* **Kubernetes:** Kubernetes is an orchestration platform that helps you manage your Docker containers.
* **AWS Elastic Beanstalk:** AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a platform that makes it easy to deploy and manage your Rails applications on AWS.
* **Heroku:** Heroku is a cloud platform that makes it easy to deploy and manage your Rails applications.

**Learn to create models and associations and uploading and reading of data (e.g., uploading articles, files, videos, and images, and reading them):**

To learn how to create models and associations and upload and read data in Rails, you can follow these resources:

* **Rails documentation:** The Rails documentation has a comprehensive guide on creating models and associations.
* **Rails Active Record:** Rails Active Record is the object-relational mapping (ORM) framework that Rails uses to interact with the database. The Active Record documentation has a guide on uploading and reading files.
* **CarrierWave:** CarrierWave is a popular gem for uploading and managing files in Rails. The CarrierWave documentation has a detailed guide on how to use it.

**Become a competent Rails backend developer:**

To become a competent Rails backend developer, you need to have a good understanding of the following:

* **Ruby:** Ruby is the programming language that Rails is written in. You need to have a good understanding of Ruby syntax and programming concepts.
* **Rails:** Rails is a web framework that provides a lot of functionality out of the box. You need to have a good understanding of how Rails works and how to use its features.
* **Databases:** Rails uses a database to store data. You need to have a good understanding of how databases work and how to use them with Rails.
* **Web development:** Rails is a web framework, so you need to have a good understanding of web development concepts like HTTP, REST, and HTML.

**Path and trajectory to develop Rails backend with GraphQL:**

Here is a possible path and trajectory to develop Rails backend with GraphQL:

1. **Learn Ruby and Rails.** There are many resources available online and in libraries to learn Ruby and Rails.
2. **Learn GraphQL.** There are many resources available online and in libraries to learn GraphQL.
3. **Build a simple Rails application with GraphQL.** This will help you to solidify your understanding of Rails and GraphQL.
4. **Contribute to open source Rails and GraphQL projects.** This is a great way to learn from other developers and improve your skills.
5. **Build more complex Rails applications with GraphQL.** As you gain more experience, you can start building more complex applications.
