Creating a microservices architecture with Ruby on Rails can be a complex task, but here's a simplified guide on how to set up two services (Catalog and Review services) and make them communicate using an API Gateway and Service Discovery. Additionally, I'll cover how to handle different ports and other considerations when designing microservices.

**1. Create the Services:**

First, create your Catalog and Review services using separate Rails applications.

**2. Define the API:**

Define the API endpoints in each service, specifying routes for retrieving and creating data. Here's a simple example for the Catalog service:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb in Catalog service
namespace :api do
  namespace :v1 do
    resources :products, only: [:index, :show, :create]
  end
end
```

Similarly, define routes for the Review service.

**3. Use Different Ports:**

You can run each service on different ports to avoid conflicts. To specify a port, use the `-p` option when starting the Rails server:

```bash
# Start Catalog service on port 3000
rails s -p 3000

# Start Review service on port 3001
rails s -p 3001
```

**4. Service Discovery:**

For service discovery, you can use tools like Consul, Eureka, or ZooKeeper to register and discover services. Let's use Consul as an example.

- Install Consul and start a local Consul server.
- Register each service with Consul using the service name and port. Here's an example in the Catalog service's configuration:

```ruby
# config/application.rb in Catalog service
config.service_name = 'catalog'
config.service_port = 3000
config.service_host = 'localhost'
```

Similarly, configure the Review service.

- When you need to make requests to another service, query Consul to discover the service's address and port. You can use a Ruby library like 'diplomat' to interact with Consul.

**5. API Gateway:**

Use an API Gateway to route requests to the appropriate service. One popular option is to use Nginx as your API Gateway. Configure Nginx to route requests to the correct service based on the URL path.

Here's a sample Nginx configuration for the API Gateway:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name api-gateway;

    location /catalog {
        proxy_pass http://catalog-service;
    }

    location /review {
        proxy_pass http://review-service;
    }
}

upstream catalog-service {
    server catalog-service-host:3000;
}

upstream review-service {
    server review-service-host:3001;
}
```

**6. Authentication and Authorization:**

When designing microservices, you'll need to consider authentication and authorization mechanisms. You can use OAuth, JWT, or API tokens for authentication and implement role-based access control for authorization.

**7. Logging and Monitoring:**

Implement centralized logging and monitoring solutions to track the performance and health of your microservices. Tools like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) and Prometheus can help.

**8. Error Handling and Resilience:**

Microservices should be resilient to failures in other services. Implement error handling, retries, and circuit breakers using libraries like `resilience` to make your system more fault-tolerant.

**9. Versioning:**

Consider API versioning to ensure backward compatibility when you update services. Prefix routes with version numbers, like `/v1/products`.

Please note that setting up a complete microservices architecture can be quite involved. This is a simplified example, and for production, you should consider using more advanced tools and patterns to manage microservices effectively.
