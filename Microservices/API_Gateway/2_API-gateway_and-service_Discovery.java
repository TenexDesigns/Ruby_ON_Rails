To use API Gateway, Service Discovery, and enable communication between microservices in a Rails application with two services (catalogue service and review service), you can follow these steps:

1. **API Gateway**: The API Gateway acts as a single entry point for all client requests and routes them to the appropriate microservices. In Rails, you can use a gem like `grape` or `rails-api` to build the API Gateway.

Here's an example of setting up an API Gateway using the `grape` gem:

```ruby
# app/api/api.rb
require 'grape'

class API < Grape::API
  prefix 'api'
  version 'v1', using: :path

  mount CatalogueService::API
  mount ReviewService::API
end
```

2. **Service Discovery**: Service Discovery helps microservices locate and communicate with each other. In Rails, you can use a service discovery tool like Consul or Eureka.

Here's an example of using Consul for service discovery:

```ruby
# config/initializers/consul.rb
require 'diplomat'

Diplomat.configure do |config|
  config.url = 'http://consul:8500' # Consul agent URL
end

# app/api/catalogue_service/api.rb
require 'grape'
require 'diplomat'

class CatalogueService::API < Grape::API
  prefix 'catalogue'
  version 'v1', using: :path

  get 'products' do
    # Use Consul to discover the review service URL
    review_service_url = Diplomat::Service.get('review-service').Address
    # Make a request to the review service
    response = HTTParty.get("#{review_service_url}/reviews")
    # Process the response and return the products with reviews
    # ...
  end
end
```

3. **Sharing Communication**: To enable communication between microservices, you can use HTTP requests. Each microservice can expose its own API endpoints, and other microservices can make HTTP requests to those endpoints.

In the example above, the Catalogue Service makes an HTTP request to the Review Service to fetch reviews for products.

4. **Using Different Ports**: In Rails, you can run multiple instances of your application on different ports to handle different microservices. You can specify the port when starting the Rails server using the `-p` option.

For example, to run the Catalogue Service on port 3000 and the Review Service on port 3001:

```bash
# Start the Catalogue Service on port 3000
rails s -p 3000

# Start the Review Service on port 3001
rails s -p 3001
```

5. **Other Considerations**: When building microservices in Rails, there are a few other things to consider:

- **Authentication and Authorization**: You'll need to implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure your microservices. You can use gems like `devise` or `jwt` for authentication and `cancancan` or `pundit` for authorization.

- **Data Storage**: Each microservice should have its own database or data store. You can use different databases for different microservices, or you can use a shared database with proper isolation.

- **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring solutions to track the performance and health of your microservices. Tools like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Prometheus can be used for this purpose.

- **Deployment and Scaling**: Consider using containerization technologies like Docker and container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes to deploy and scale your microservices.

When using GraphQL in Rails for microservices, you can follow similar patterns for API Gateway, Service Discovery, and communication between microservices. The main difference would be in the implementation of the GraphQL schema and resolvers.

You can define separate GraphQL schemas for each microservice and use resolvers to fetch data from the respective microservices. The API Gateway can handle the incoming GraphQL queries and route them to the appropriate microservice's GraphQL endpoint.

Additionally, you may need to consider caching strategies, error handling, and performance optimization techniques specific to GraphQL in a microservices architecture.

These are some of the key aspects to consider when building microservices in Rails and using GraphQL. It's important to design your microservices with proper boundaries and communication patterns to ensure a scalable and maintainable architecture.
