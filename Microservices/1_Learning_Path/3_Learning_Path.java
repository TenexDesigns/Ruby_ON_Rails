To avoid being sidetracked when learning microservices with Rails and GraphQL, you should focus on the following topics:

* **Microservices architecture:** This includes understanding the concepts of microservices, such as domain-driven design, bounded contexts, and service per domain.
* **Containerization:** This includes understanding how to containerize your microservices using Docker.
* **Orchestration:** This includes understanding how to orchestrate your Docker containers using Kubernetes.
* **Service discovery:** This includes understanding how to register and discover your microservices using a service registry such as Consul or Eureka.
* **API gateway:** This includes understanding how to use an API gateway to manage and secure your microservices APIs.
* **GraphQL:** This includes understanding the basics of GraphQL, such as queries, mutations, and types.
* **Rails GraphQL:** This includes understanding how to use Rails to build GraphQL APIs.

Once you have a good understanding of these topics, you can start to learn about more advanced topics such as event-driven architecture, load balancing, and security.

Here is a possible learning path:

1. Start by learning about the microservices architecture. There are many resources available online and in books.
2. Once you have a good understanding of the microservices architecture, start to learn about containerization and orchestration. Docker and Kubernetes are the most popular technologies for containerization and orchestration, respectively.
3. Next, learn about service discovery. Consul and Eureka are two popular service registries.
4. Once you have a good understanding of service discovery, start to learn about API gateways. Nginx and AWS API Gateway are two popular API gateways.
5. Finally, learn about GraphQL and Rails GraphQL. There are many resources available online and in books.

It is important to note that this is just a suggested learning path. You can adjust it to fit your own needs and interests.

Here are some of the most important topics to cover:

* Microservices architecture
* Containerization
* Orchestration
* Service discovery
* API gateway
* GraphQL
* Rails GraphQL

These topics are essential for developing microservices in Rails and GraphQL.

I hope this helps!
