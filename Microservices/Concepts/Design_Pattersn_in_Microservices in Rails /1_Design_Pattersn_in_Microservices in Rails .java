Yes, the microservices patterns that you mentioned can be applied to Rails GraphQL API microservices. Here is a brief overview of each pattern:

**Event Sourcing**

Event sourcing is a pattern where all state changes are recorded as a sequence of events. This allows you to easily replay the sequence of events to reconstruct the state of the system at any point in time.

**Aggregator Pattern**

The aggregator pattern is a pattern where one microservice is responsible for aggregating data from multiple microservices. This can be useful for providing a unified view of the data or for performing complex calculations.

**Circuit Breaker**

The circuit breaker pattern is a pattern that can be used to prevent cascading failures in a microservices architecture. It works by monitoring the health of other microservices and failing requests if those microservices are down.

**Client Side UI Composition Pattern**

The client side UI composition pattern is a pattern where the user interface is composed of reusable components that are provided by different microservices. This allows you to easily create complex and dynamic user interfaces.

**Communication Patterns**

Communication patterns are design patterns that define how microservices communicate with each other. Some common communication patterns include synchronous communication, asynchronous communication, and event-driven communication.

**Cross-Cutting Concerns Patterns**

Cross-cutting concerns patterns are design patterns that address common problems that arise when developing distributed systems. Some common cross-cutting concerns include logging, tracing, and security.

**Data Base Patterns**

Data base patterns are design patterns that help you to design and implement efficient and scalable databases for microservices architectures. Some common data base patterns include the shard pattern, the denormalization pattern, and the aggregate root pattern.

**Decomposition Patterns**

Decomposition patterns are design patterns that help you to decompose your application into microservices. Some common decomposition patterns include the domain-driven design pattern, the bounded context pattern, and the service per domain pattern.

**Deployment Patterns**

Deployment patterns are design patterns that help you to deploy and manage microservices in production. Some common deployment patterns include the containerization pattern, the orchestration pattern, and the service mesh pattern.

**Event-Driven Architecture**

An event-driven architecture is a software design pattern in which components communicate by sending and receiving events. This pattern is well-suited for microservices architectures, as it allows microservices to communicate with each other without having to know about their internal implementation.

**GraphQL**

GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data that they need. This makes it a good choice for microservices architectures, as it can help to reduce the amount of data that is transferred between microservices.

**Integration Patterns**

Integration patterns are design patterns that help you to integrate different systems together. Some common integration patterns include the request-reply pattern, the publish-subscribe pattern, and the choreography pattern.

**Load Balancers**

Load balancers are used to distribute traffic across multiple microservices. This can help to improve performance and reliability.

**Microservices Anti-patterns**

Microservices anti-patterns are design patterns that should be avoided when developing microservices architectures. Some common microservices anti-patterns include the distributed monolith pattern, the chatty microservices pattern, and the too granular microservices pattern.

**Microservices Security Patterns**

Microservices security patterns are design patterns that help you to secure microservices architectures. Some common microservices security patterns include the API key pattern, the JWT pattern, and the mutual TLS pattern.

**Observable Patterns**

Observable patterns are design patterns that help you to implement reactive programming patterns in a microservices architecture. Some common observable patterns include the Observer pattern, the Observable pattern, and the Subject pattern.

**Tools**

Here are some tools that you can use for developing and managing microservices in Rails:

* **Docker** is a containerization platform that allows you to package your microservices into containers.
* **Kubernetes** is an orchestration platform that helps you to manage your Docker containers.
* **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** is a platform that makes it easy to deploy and manage your Rails applications on AWS.
* **Heroku** is a platform that makes it easy to deploy and manage your Rails applications.
* **Istio** is a service mesh that helps you to connect, manage, and secure microservices.
* **Linkerd** is a service mesh that helps you to make your microservices more reliable and performant.
* **Gloo Edge** is an API gateway that helps you to manage and secure your microservices APIs.
* **Tyk** is an API gateway that helps you to manage and secure your microservices APIs.
* **Kong** is an API gateway that helps you to manage and secure your microservices APIs.

I hope this helps! Please let me know if you have any other questions.
