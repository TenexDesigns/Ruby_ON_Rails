Yes, GraphQL Rails API can be used in a microservices architecture. In fact, GraphQL is a good choice for microservices because it allows you to query multiple services with a single request.

To use GraphQL in a microservices architecture, you would need to create a GraphQL gateway service. This service would be responsible for routing GraphQL requests to the appropriate microservices.

The GraphQL gateway service would also need to be responsible for aggregating the results from the different microservices and returning them to the client in a single response.

One way to implement a GraphQL gateway service is to use a tool like Apollo Federation. Apollo Federation is a set of tools that make it easy to build and manage GraphQL federations.

Here is an example of how to use Apollo Federation to implement a GraphQL gateway service for a microservices architecture:

1. Create a GraphQL schema for the gateway service. This schema will define the types and queries that are available to the client.
2. Use Apollo Federation to register the microservices with the gateway service.
3. Implement the resolvers for the queries in the gateway service schema. These resolvers will be responsible for routing the requests to the appropriate microservices and aggregating the results.

Once the GraphQL gateway service is implemented, clients can use it to query the microservices without having to know anything about the underlying microservices architecture.

**Who will be making the queries?**

The GraphQL gateway service will be responsible for making the queries to the microservices on behalf of the client. The client will only need to know about the GraphQL gateway service and its schema.

Here is an example of how a client would query the microservices through the GraphQL gateway service:

```
query {
  users {
    name
    email
  }
}
```

The GraphQL gateway service would route this query to the microservices that are responsible for managing users. The gateway service would then aggregate the results from the microservices and return them to the client in a single response.

**Benefits of using GraphQL in a microservices architecture:**

* GraphQL allows you to query multiple services with a single request. This can improve performance and reduce network traffic.
* GraphQL allows you to expose a unified API to the client, even if the underlying microservices use different data models and APIs.
* GraphQL is flexible and allows you to evolve your microservices architecture without having to change the client API.

**Overall, GraphQL is a good choice for microservices because it is flexible, scalable, and performant.**
