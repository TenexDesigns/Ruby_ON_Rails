Microservices for a Cooking App

Here are some microservices that you could use for a small to medium-sized cooking app:

* **Posts:** This microservice would be responsible for managing posts, including videos, recipes, and pictures of food. It would also be responsible for managing comments on posts.
* **Users:** This microservice would be responsible for managing users, including their profiles, followers, and followed users.
* **Notifications:** This microservice would be responsible for sending notifications to users, such as when they receive a new comment on one of their posts or when someone starts following them.

Database Design and Associations in Rails API with GraphQL

Here is a possible database design for a cooking app using Rails API and GraphQL:

```
# Posts table
id | user_id | title | body | type | url
-- | -------- | ------ | ---- | ---- | ---

# Users table
id | username | email | profile_picture_url
-- | -------- | ----- | -----------------

# Followers table
user_id | follower_id
-- | --------------

# Notifications table
id | user_id | message | read
-- | -------- | -------- | ----
```

The `Posts` table would store information about posts, such as the user who created the post, the title of the post, the body of the post, the type of post (video, recipe, or picture of food), and the URL of the post (if applicable).

The `Users` table would store information about users, such as their username, email address, and profile picture URL.

The `Followers` table would store information about who follows whom.

The `Notifications` table would store information about notifications, such as the user who received the notification, the message of the notification, and whether the notification has been read.

Here are some examples of associations between the tables:

* A `Post` belongs to a `User`.
* A `User` has many `Posts`.
* A `User` has many `Followers`.
* A `User` has many `Notifications`.
* A `Follower` belongs to a `User`.
* A `Follower` belongs to a `User`.
* A `Notification` belongs to a `User`.

Microservice Communication

To establish communication between the microservices, you could use a message broker such as RabbitMQ. Each microservice would publish messages to its own exchange and consume messages from the exchanges of other microservices.

For example, the `Posts` microservice could publish a message to the `users_exchange` exchange when a new user is created. The `Users` microservice could then consume this message and update the user's profile accordingly.

Another option for microservice communication is to use a direct HTTP API. Each microservice would expose an API that other microservices can consume.

For example, the `Posts` microservice could expose an API that the `Notifications` microservice could use to send notifications to users.

Databases

You could use a variety of databases for a cooking app. Two popular options are Cassandra and PostgreSQL.

Cassandra is a good choice for applications that need to handle a large volume of data and require high scalability and performance.

PostgreSQL is a good choice for applications that require complex data modeling and ACID transactions.

In this case, you could use Cassandra to store the `Posts` table and PostgreSQL to store the `Users`, `Followers`, and `Notifications` tables.

Which database you choose will depend on your specific requirements.
