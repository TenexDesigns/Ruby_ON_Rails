For a small to medium-sized cooking app with the described features, you can design a microservices architecture to keep the application scalable, maintainable, and efficient. Here's a breakdown of the microservices you might consider:

1. **User Service**: This microservice handles user-related operations, including user registration, authentication, user profiles, and user-following relationships. It's responsible for managing user data, such as usernames, email addresses, and user preferences.

2. **Post Service**: This service manages the creation and retrieval of posts. Posts can include videos, recipes, images, and user-generated content. Each post is associated with a user. The Post Service should also handle comment-related functionalities.

3. **Media Service**: As your app allows users to share videos, images, and potentially other media, a separate microservice can handle media storage and retrieval. You can use cloud-based storage solutions like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage to store the media files.

4. **Recipe Service**: This microservice manages the creation and retrieval of recipes. It can store recipe details, ingredients, and associated images. Users can create, edit, and view recipes.

5. **Ingredient Service**: For managing ingredients and their details, this service can be responsible. Users can add ingredients to their recipes, and the service can provide information about each ingredient.

Regarding databases, you can use a combination of databases based on the requirements of each microservice:

1. **User Service**: Use a traditional relational database like PostgreSQL to store user information and relationships.

2. **Post Service**: A NoSQL database like MongoDB could be suitable for storing posts and comments. You can also use PostgreSQL or a similar relational database for structured data within posts.

3. **Media Service**: Use cloud-based storage like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage for media files. You can store metadata in a database or a metadata store.

4. **Recipe Service**: A relational database like PostgreSQL can effectively store recipe data, including ingredient details.

5. **Ingredient Service**: A relational database like PostgreSQL can handle ingredient data.

As for microservice communication, consider using GraphQL as you mentioned. GraphQL is an efficient way to handle communication between microservices. Each microservice exposes a GraphQL API, and the front-end application sends queries to the relevant services to retrieve the necessary data.

To establish communication between microservices:

1. **API Gateway**: Implement an API Gateway that routes incoming GraphQL requests to the appropriate microservices. It acts as a single entry point for the client application and routes requests based on the content of the query.

2. **Authentication and Authorization**: Ensure that each microservice handles authentication and authorization independently. You might use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for this purpose.

3. **Service Discovery**: Use service discovery tools or libraries to locate and communicate with other microservices. Tools like Consul or libraries provided by your chosen infrastructure platform can help in this regard.

4. **Data Consistency**: Implement data consistency and data synchronization mechanisms between microservices, especially when data relationships span multiple services. Event-driven architecture with a message broker like RabbitMQ or Kafka can help maintain consistency.

5. **Error Handling and Monitoring**: Implement proper error handling and monitoring across microservices to ensure the health and reliability of the application.

When designing the database schema and associations in Rails API with GraphQL, ensure that each microservice has its own database and schema, and relationships between microservices are managed via unique identifiers (UUIDs) or other suitable mechanisms to maintain data integrity.

Remember that the choice of microservices, databases, and communication mechanisms should align with the specific scalability and performance requirements of your application. You can start with a monolithic architecture initially and then gradually migrate to a microservices architecture as the application grows in complexity and scale.
