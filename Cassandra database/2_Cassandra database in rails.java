To use Apache Cassandra with a Rails API application, you'll need to use the 'cassandra-driver' gem. Apache Cassandra is a highly scalable NoSQL database that provides high availability and fault tolerance.

Here are the steps to integrate Cassandra with a Rails API application:

### Step 1: Install Cassandra

First, you'll need to install Cassandra on your system. You can follow the instructions provided on the official [Apache Cassandra website](http://cassandra.apache.org/download/).

### Step 2: Include the Cassandra Driver Gem

Add the 'cassandra-driver' gem to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'cassandra-driver'
```

Then, run `bundle install` to install the gem.

### Step 3: Establish a Connection with Cassandra

In an initializer file (e.g., `config/initializers/cassandra.rb`), establish a connection to Cassandra:

```ruby
require 'cassandra'

cluster = Cassandra.cluster(username: 'username', password: 'password')
session = cluster.connect('keyspace') # connect to your keyspace
```

Replace `'username'`, `'password'`, and `'keyspace'` with your actual Cassandra username, password, and keyspace.

### Step 4: Interact with Cassandra

Now you can use the `session` object to interact with Cassandra. For example, to execute CQL (Cassandra Query Language) statements:

```ruby
results = session.execute('SELECT * FROM my_table')
results.each do |row|
  puts row['column_name'] # replace 'column_name' with your actual column name
end
```

Remember that Cassandra is a NoSQL database, so it doesn't support ActiveRecord and its associated helpers. You'll need to interact with it using CQL.

Also, note that it's important to manage your Cassandra connections properly. Creating a new connection for each request can lead to performance issues. It's usually a good idea to establish a connection when your application starts and reuse it for all requests [Source 2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2382436/is-cassandra-production-ready-for-ruby-on-rails), [Source 7](https://www.baeldung.com/cassandra-with-java).

Regarding your question about using both Cassandra and PostgreSQL, it's certainly possible. You can use Cassandra for handling large amounts of write-heavy, unstructured data, and PostgreSQL for structured data that requires complex queries. The choice depends on your specific use case.

For communication between microservices, you can use HTTP/REST, gRPC, GraphQL, message queues (like RabbitMQ as described previously), or other mechanisms depending on your requirements and infrastructure. The key is to ensure that the communication is reliable, efficient, and secure.
