To use Cassandra database in a Rails API app, you can use the following steps:

1. Install the required gems:

```
gem install cassandra-driver
gem install cassie-rails
```

2. Configure your Rails app to connect to Cassandra:

```ruby
# config/database.yml
development:
  adapter: cassie
  hosts: ['localhost']
  port: 9042
  keyspace: 'my_app_development'
```

3. Generate a Cassandra schema migration:

```
rake cequel:migration:generate
```

4. Write your migrations to create and update your Cassandra tables.

5. Run your migrations:

```
rake cequel:migrate
```

6. Create models for your Cassandra tables:

```ruby
# app/models/post.rb
class Post < Cassie::Model
  key :id, :uuid

  column :title, :string
  column :body, :string
  column :type, :string
  column :url, :string

  belongs_to :user
end
```

7. Interact with your Cassandra models in your Rails controllers and other code.

For example, the following code would create a new `Post` record:

```ruby
post = Post.new(title: 'My new post', body: 'This is the body of my new post.', type: 'video', url: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ')
post.save
```

You can also use the following code to retrieve all `Post` records:

```ruby
posts = Post.all
```

Cassandra is a powerful database that can be used to build scalable and performant Rails API apps.

Here are some tips for using Cassandra effectively in Rails API apps:

* Use Cassandra for data that is read more often than it is written.
* Use Cassandra for data that is partitioned well.
* Use Cassandra for data that is not as critical to your application as data stored in a relational database.
* Use a caching layer to reduce the number of reads and writes to Cassandra.
* Use a schema management tool to keep your Cassandra schema up to date.

By following these tips, you can use Cassandra to build fast and reliable Rails API apps.
