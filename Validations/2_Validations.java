The article discusses model validations in Ruby on Rails, specifically focusing on how to use Active Record validations to ensure the data being added to a database is valid and secure. It provides explanations and code samples to illustrate how to implement these validations in a Rails application.

Here's a breakdown of the key points discussed in the article with relevant code samples:

1. **Active Record and Model Validations**:
   The article begins by introducing Active Record, which is responsible for the model part of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture in Rails. Active Record allows you to map Ruby classes to database tables and perform SQL queries using Ruby objects.

2. **The Need for Data Validation**:
   It emphasizes the importance of data validation to ensure that data added to the database is secure and functional. This is especially important for server-side validation, where client-side validation might not be sufficient.

3. **Validation Helpers**:
   The article introduces several validation helpers provided by Active Record, including `presence`, `uniqueness`, `length`, and `on` validations. These helpers make it easy to define common validations for model attributes.

4. **Code Samples**:
   The article provides code samples to illustrate how to use these validation helpers. Here are some examples:

   - Using `presence` validation:
     ```ruby
     class User < ApplicationRecord
       validates :username, :password, :bio, presence: true
     end
     ```

   - Using `uniqueness` validation:
     ```ruby
     class User < ApplicationRecord
       validates :username, uniqueness: true
     end
     ```

   - Customizing error messages:
     ```ruby
     class User < ApplicationRecord
       validates :username, uniqueness: { message: 'An account associated with %{value} already exists' }
     end
     ```

   - Using `length` validation:
     ```ruby
     class User < ApplicationRecord
       validates :password, length: { in: 5..15 }
       validates :bio, length: { maximum: 2000 }
     end
     ```

   - Specifying when validations should be performed:
     ```ruby
     class User < ApplicationRecord
       validates :password, length: { in: 5..15 }, on: :create
     end
     ```

5. **Controller Actions and Validation Checks**:
   The article demonstrates how to use the `valid?` method in the controller to check the validity of data before it is saved to the database. If the data is valid, it responds with a success status; otherwise, it sends an error response with error messages.

6. **Handling Validation Errors**:
   The article explains how validation errors can be accessed and used in case a validation fails. It mentions the `full_messages` method, which provides an array of error messages that can be sent to the client side.

7. **Sample Console Output**:
   The article provides sample console outputs, showing how responses from the API may differ based on whether validations pass or fail.

In summary, this article provides a comprehensive overview of using Active Record validations in a Ruby on Rails application. It covers the basics of data validation, various validation helpers, customization of error messages, and handling validation errors in the context of a Rails API. The code samples make it easier for readers to understand how to implement these concepts in their own applications.
