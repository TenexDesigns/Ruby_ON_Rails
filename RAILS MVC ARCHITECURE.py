Rails follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which helps in structuring and organizing the codebase. 
The MVC pattern separates the concerns of data management, presentation, and user interactions. 
Heres an explanation of the MVC architecture in Rails along with code samples:

Model:
  
The model represents the data and business logic of the application.
It interacts with the database and encapsulates the behavior and rules associated with the data.

Example model file (app/models/student.rb):


class Student < ApplicationRecord
  validates :name, presence: true
  validates :email, presence: true, uniqueness: true
end

In the above example, the Student model inherits from ApplicationRecord,
which is a base class provided by Rails. It includes functionality for interacting with the database using ActiveRecord.
The model also defines validations to ensure that a students name and email are present and unique.


View:
  
The view handles the presentation layer of the application. 
It is responsible for rendering the user interface and displaying data to the user.

Example view file (app/views/students/index.html.erb):


<h1>All Students</h1>
<ul>
  <% @students.each do |student| %>
    <li><%= student.name %></li>
  <% end %>
</ul>
In the above example, the view displays a list of all students. 
It uses embedded Ruby (ERB) tags to iterate over the @students instance variable (provided by the controller) 
and display each students name.

Controller:
The controller acts as an intermediary between the model and the view.
It handles user requests, interacts with the model to fetch data, and prepares the data to be presented in the view.

Example controller file (app/controllers/students_controller.rb):


class StudentsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @students = Student.all
  end
end
In the above example, the StudentsController defines an index action. 
It fetches all students from the database using the Student model and assigns them to the @students instance variable, 
which is then accessible in the corresponding view.

By following the MVC pattern, Rails provides separation of concerns, making the codebase more maintainable and testable.
The flow of control in the MVC architecture typically follows this sequence:

A user makes a request, which is received by the router.
The router maps the request to the appropriate controller action.
The controller performs any necessary data retrieval or manipulation through the model.
The controller passes the data to the view.
The view renders the HTML or other output to be sent back as a response to the user.
Overall, the MVC architecture in Rails helps in keeping the codebase organized,
promotes reusability, and separates concerns, making it easier to maintain and extend the application.





MORE EXPLANATION
**************************************************************************************

In Ruby on Rails, the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is used to organize code and separate concerns.
Here's a brief explanation of each component:

Model: The Model is responsible for interacting with the database and performing business logic.
  It encapsulates the data in the application and provides an interface for accessing and manipulating that data. 
  Models are usually defined in the app/models directory and inherit from ActiveRecord::Base.
View: The View is responsible for presenting data to the user and handling user input. 
  Its the part of the application that the user interacts with directly, and includes HTML, CSS,
  and JavaScript. Views are usually defined in the app/views directory and are rendered by the controller.
Controller: The Controller is responsible for processing incoming requests, interacting with the model to retrieve data,
  and rendering the appropriate view. Its the glue that connects the Model and View components. 
  Controllers are usually defined in the app/controllers directory and inherit from ApplicationController.
Rails uses Convention over Configuration (CoC) to reduce the amount of boilerplate code you need to write.
This means that Rails makes assumptions about how your application is structured,
and provides sensible defaults that you can override if necessary. For example, 
if you define a controller named ProductsController, Rails will automatically look for a corresponding
view in app/views/products. Similarly, if you define a model named Product, Rails will automatically look
for a corresponding table named products in the database.

To create a new Rails application, you can use the rails new command followed by the name of your application. 
This will generate a set of directories and files that follow the MVC pattern and provide a basic structure for
your application. You can then create controllers, models, and views as needed to build out your application.

In summary, the MVC pattern is a key aspect of Ruby on Rails, and is used to organize code and separate concerns.
By following the conventions provided by Rails, you can reduce the amount of boilerplate code you need to write 
and focus on building your application.
