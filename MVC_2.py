Sure, here is an explanation of the Rails MVC architecture, with code samples:

Model

The model is the layer of the application that is responsible for storing and retrieving data.
It is typically implemented as a collection of Ruby objects that map to database tables.
The model layer is responsible for all of the data access in the application, including:

Creating, reading, updating, and deleting data
Validating data
Formatting data for presentation
Controller

The controller is the layer of the application that is responsible for handling user requests.
It receives requests from the user, determines what action to take, and then delegates that action to the appropriate model or view. 
The controller layer is responsible for all of the application logic, including:

Routing requests to the appropriate action
Initializing models and views
Rendering views
Handling errors
View

The view is the layer of the application that is responsible for displaying data to the user.
It renders HTML templates that are populated with data from the model. The view layer is responsible for all of the user interface in the application, including:

Rendering HTML templates
Handling user input
Communicating with the controller
Here is an example of a Rails MVC application:

Ruby
# app/models/product.rb
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  validates :name, presence: true
end

# app/controllers/products_controller.rb
class ProductsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @products = Product.all
  end

  def show
    @product = Product.find(params[:id])
  end
end

# app/views/products/index.html.erb
<h1>Products</h1>

<ul>
  <% @products.each do |product| %>
    <li><%= product.name %></li>
  <% end %>
</ul>

# app/views/products/show.html.erb
<h1><%= @product.name %></h1>

<p><%= @product.description %></p>

This is just a simple example, but it shows the basic structure of a Rails MVC application. 
The model layer stores data in the database, the controller layer handles user requests,
and the view layer renders HTML templates. By using this architecture, Rails applications are easy to develop, test, and deploy.
