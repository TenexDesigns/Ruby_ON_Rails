In a Ruby on Rails application, the business logic should be organized and placed in the appropriate layer of your application. Rails follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, but it also encourages the use of service objects and other design patterns to keep your code organized and maintainable. Here's how you can structure your application to handle business logic effectively:

1. **Models**: Models in Rails represent the data and encapsulate the logic for interacting with the database. They typically contain validations, associations, and some basic business logic. While simple data-related logic can reside in models, it's recommended to keep complex business logic out of the models to maintain separation of concerns.

2. **Controllers**: Controllers handle incoming requests, process them, and decide how to respond. While controllers are responsible for managing the flow of your application, they should be kept thin. They should only include code related to handling HTTP requests, parsing parameters, and invoking the appropriate service objects or model methods to perform business logic.

3. **Views**: Views in Rails are responsible for rendering the HTML or other response format. They should contain minimal logic and be focused on presenting data to the user. Avoid placing business logic in views to maintain clarity and separation of concerns.

4. **Service Objects**: Service objects are plain Ruby classes that encapsulate complex business logic. They can be created in the `app/services` directory. Service objects are a great way to keep your controllers and models clean by moving complex operations, calculations, and data manipulations into a dedicated class.

   For example, if you have complex business logic related to creating an invoice, you can create an `InvoiceService` class and place the logic there.

```ruby
# app/services/invoice_service.rb
class InvoiceService
  def self.generate_invoice(user, items)
    # Complex business logic to generate an invoice
  end
end
```

5. **Libraries**: For reusable, domain-specific logic that doesn't fit neatly into models or service objects, you can create libraries or modules. These can be placed in the `lib` directory and loaded when needed.

6. **Concerns**: Rails allows you to define concerns to modularize common functionality shared among models and controllers. Concerns can be used for shared business logic and code that doesn't belong in a single model or controller.

7. **Custom Classes**: Depending on the complexity of your business logic, you may create custom classes or modules to handle specific tasks. These can be organized in a way that makes sense for your application.

In summary, business logic should be extracted from controllers and models to keep them slim and maintainable. Service objects, concerns, and custom classes are excellent choices for encapsulating complex business logic, while controllers and models should primarily handle request/response handling and database interactions, respectively. A well-structured Rails application will be easier to maintain and understand.
