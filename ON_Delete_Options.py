e.gclass Post < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :comments, dependent: :destroy
                      -------------------------------> This is what we are discussing
  after_destroy :log_deleted_comments

  private

  def log_deleted_comments
    logger.info "Deleted #{comments.count} comments."
  end
end



The dependent: option in Ruby on Rails is used to specify the behavior of associated objects when the parent object is destroyed.


The dependent: :destroy
    option specified in this line ensures that when a Post is destroyed, 
    all associated Comment records are also destroyed. This is known as a cascading delete. 
    In other words, when a Post is deleted, all associated Comment records will be deleted as well to maintain data integrity.









In addition to the dependent: :destroy option, Rails provides several other options that can be used with the has_many 
    association to specify the behavior when associated records are deleted. Let's discuss a few of these options with code samples:

dependent: :nullify:
This option nullifies the foreign key in the associated records instead of deleting them.
It sets the foreign key to NULL, effectively breaking the association.


class Post < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :comments, dependent: :nullify
end
With this configuration, when a Post is deleted, the foreign key post_id in the associated Comment records will be 
set to NULL. The associated comments will still exist, but they will no longer be associated with any specific post.

dependent: :restrict_with_exception:
This option raises an exception if there are associated records when an attempt is made to delete the parent record.
It prevents the deletion of the parent record when there are dependent records.

ruby
Copy code
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :comments, dependent: :restrict_with_exception
end
If a Post has associated Comment records and an attempt is made to delete the Post, it will raise an exception,
preventing the deletion.

dependent: :delete_all:
This option performs a direct SQL DELETE query to delete all associated records without triggering callbacks or validations. 
It bypasses the ActiveRecord delete method.


class Post < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :comments, dependent: :delete_all
end
When a Post is deleted, the associated Comment records will be deleted using a SQL DELETE query without invoking 
any callbacks or validations.

dependent: :restrict_with_error:
This option is similar to restrict_with_exception, but it raises an error instead of an exception. 
The error message is added to the errors collection of the parent record.


class Post < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :comments, dependent: :restrict_with_error
end
If a Post has associated Comment records and an attempt is made to delete the Post,
it will add an error to the Post object's errors collection, preventing the deletion.

These are just a few examples of the available dependent options for the has_many association in Rails.
Each option provides different behavior when deleting associated records, allowing you to choose the most appropriate option based on your specific requirements and data integrity needs.










MORE EXPLANATION
*****************************************************************************************************************************


The dependent: :destroy option in Ruby on Rails is used to specify that a dependent model should be destroyed when its
    parent model is destroyed.
    For example, if you have a User model and a Post model, and a User can have many Posts,
    
    you could use the dependent: :destroy option to specify that all of the Posts associated with a User should be
        destroyed when the User is destroyed.

To use the dependent: :destroy option, you need to add it to the belongs_to or has_many association in your model.
    For example, the following code specifies that all of the Posts associated with a User should
    be destroyed when the User is destroyed:

Code snippet
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :posts, dependent: :destroy
end
Use code with caution. Learn more
When a User is destroyed, Rails will call the destroy method on all of the Posts associated with the User. 
This will cause the Posts to be destroyed.

The dependent: :destroy option is a powerful tool for ensuring that your data is consistent.
    By using this option, you can be sure that all of the dependent data will be destroyed when the parent data is destroyed.

In addition to dependent: :destroy, there are a few other options available for controlling the behavior of dependent models.
    These options are:

dependent: :nullify - This option specifies that the dependent model should be
    set to null when its parent model is destroyed.
dependent: :restrict_with_error - This option specifies that an error should be raised if an attempt 
    is made to destroy a parent model that has associated dependent models.
dependent: :restrict_with_exception - This option specifies that an exception should be raised if
    an attempt is made to destroy a parent model that has associated dependent models.
The dependent: :nullify option is useful if you want to keep the dependent data,
but you dont want it to be associated with the parent model anymore.
The dependent: :restrict_with_error option is useful if you want to prevent users from destroying parent
 models that have associated dependent models. The dependent: :restrict_with_exception option is the most
restrictive option, and it will prevent users from destroying parent models that have associated dependent models,
even if they are trying to do so explicitly.

The dependent option is a powerful tool for controlling the behavior of dependent models.
By using this option, you can ensure that your data is consistent and that users cannot accidentally destroy data 
that they should not be destroying.

The :dependent option in Ruby on Rails is used to specify the behavior of associated objects when 
  the parent object is destroyed. It can be used in belongs_to associations and can take different forms, 
  such as :destroy, :delete, :destroy_all, and :delete_all stackoverflow.com, stackoverflow.com.

:dependent => :destroy or :dependent => :destroy_all: When the parent object is destroyed, 
          the associated objects are destroyed by calling their destroy method. 
          This is useful when you need to perform validations or callbacks on the associated objects before they
          are deleted from the database.
class Author < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :books
end

class Book < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :author
end
If an author is destroyed, their books will also be destroyed, calling their destroy method.

:dependent => :delete or :dependent => :delete_all: When the parent object is destroyed, 
          the associated objects are deleted directly from the database without calling their destroy method. 
          This is useful when you dont need to perform any additional actions on the associated objects before deleting them.
class Author < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :books
end

class Book < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :author
end
If an author is destroyed, their books will also be deleted directly from the database without calling their destroy method.

Rails 6.1 introduced a new option, :dependent => :destroy_async,
    which allows associated objects to be destroyed asynchronously using background jobs blog.saeloun.com,
    planetscale.com. This is useful when you want to avoid running a large number of deletes within a single transaction,
    which could impact performance.

class Author < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :books
end

class Book < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :author
end
If an author is destroyed, their books will be destroyed asynchronously using background jobs.

In summary, the :dependent option in Ruby on Rails is used to control the behavior of associated objects when the 
  parent object is destroyed. It can take different forms, such as :destroy, :delete, :destroy_all, :delete_all,
          and :destroy_async. Choosing the appropriate form depends on your applications requirements and performance considerations.
