Caching in a Rails API involves storing and reusing frequently requested data to improve the application's performance. Caching reduces the load on the server and speeds up responses to client requests. In Rails, you can implement caching at various levels, including fragment caching, page caching, and low-level caching using tools like `Rails.cache`.

Here's how to implement caching in a Rails API with code samples:

**1. Fragment Caching:**

Fragment caching involves caching parts of a view or data that can be reused across multiple requests. For example, caching the HTML rendering of a frequently accessed API response.

In your controller or view, you can use the `cache` helper to define the cache key and the content to be cached.

```ruby
# In your controller action
def show
  @post = Post.find(params[:id])
  @comments = @post.comments

  # Cache the API response for each post
  cache_key = "api_v1_post_#{params[:id]}_#{params[:format]}"
  @cached_response = Rails.cache.fetch(cache_key, expires_in: 1.hour) do
    render_to_string template: 'posts/show', formats: [:json], locals: { post: @post, comments: @comments }
  end

  render json: @cached_response
end
```

**2. Page Caching:**

Page caching involves caching entire API responses, which is suitable for read-heavy APIs where the data doesn't change frequently.

To enable page caching in Rails, you can use the `caches_page` method in your controller. For example, in your `PostsController`:

```ruby
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  caches_page :show, :index

  def show
    @post = Post.find(params[:id])
    render json: @post
  end

  # ...
end
```

This will automatically cache the response of the `show` and `index` actions as HTML files on your server.

**3. Low-Level Caching:**

You can also use low-level caching to cache data or computations at the application level using the `Rails.cache` interface. This allows you to cache arbitrary data.

Here's an example of caching a database query:

```ruby
# In your controller action
def index
  @posts = Rails.cache.fetch('all_posts', expires_in: 1.hour) do
    Post.all
  end

  render json: @posts
end
```

In this example, the `Post.all` query result is cached, and it will be reused for subsequent requests for one hour before the cache expires.

**Cache Expiry and Invalidation:**

It's essential to set an appropriate cache expiry time, so cached data doesn't become stale. You can use the `expires_in` option in the `Rails.cache.fetch` method.

To invalidate the cache, you can use the `Rails.cache.delete` method with the appropriate cache key when the underlying data changes.

**Cache Stores:**

By default, Rails uses the `:file_store` cache store, which caches data on the filesystem. However, you can configure other cache stores like Memcached, Redis, or database stores by modifying your `config/application.rb`.

```ruby
config.cache_store = :mem_cache_store
```

Caching can significantly improve the performance of your Rails API, especially for frequently requested data or computationally expensive operations. Choose the appropriate caching strategy based on your API's characteristics and requirements.
