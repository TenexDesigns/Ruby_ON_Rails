To install Rails version 6.1, you'll need to use RubyGems, which is the package manager for Ruby. Here are the steps to install Rails 6.1:

1. **Install Ruby**: Ensure you have Ruby installed on your system. You can check your current Ruby version by running:

   ```bash
   ruby -v
   ```

   If Ruby is not installed, youll need to install it. You can use a version manager like RVM or rbenv, or install it directly from your system's package manager (e.g., `apt`, `yum`, `brew`).

2. **Install Rails**: Once you have Ruby installed, you can install Rails using RubyGems. Open your terminal and run the following command:

   ```bash
   gem install rails -v 6.1
   ```

   This command tells RubyGems to install Rails version 6.1.

3. **Verify Installation**: After the installation is complete, you can verify that Rails 6.1 is installed by running:

   ```bash
   rails -v
   ```

   This should display the version number, indicating that Rails 6.1 is successfully installed.

4. **Optional: Create a New Rails Application**: If you want to create a new Rails application using version 6.1, you can run:

   ```bash
   rails new myapp
   ```

   Replace `myapp` with the name of your application. This command will generate a new Rails project using Rails 6.1.

That's it! You now have Rails version 6.1 installed on your system. You can start developing your Rails applications using this version.
