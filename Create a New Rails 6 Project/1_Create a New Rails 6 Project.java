Create a New Rails 6 Project:

If you're starting a new project and want to use Rails 6, you can create a new Rails 6 project explicitly by running:

bash
Copy code
rails _6.0.4_ new my_app
This command creates a new Rails application using version 6.0.4.

Modifying the Rails version to an older major version is not recommended because it may lead to compatibility issues and require changes in your application code. It's better to specify a specific minor version of Rails 6 or lock the version to ensure your application remains stable.
