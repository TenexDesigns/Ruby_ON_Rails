There are many WebSocket client libraries available, but some of the most popular ones that can be used in Next.js, React, or any other front-end framework include:

* **Socket.IO** is a popular JavaScript library that makes it easy to implement real-time, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. It provides a high-level abstraction over the WebSocket protocol, and it also includes a number of features that make it easy to build real-time applications, such as support for namespaces, events, and rooms.
* **ws** is a lightweight JavaScript library that provides a low-level abstraction over the WebSocket protocol. It is a good choice for applications that need to have more control over the WebSocket connection.
* **React WebSocket** is a React library that makes it easy to use WebSockets in React applications. It provides a high-level component that abstracts away the details of the WebSocket connection, and it also includes a number of features that make it easy to build real-time applications, such as support for state management and event handling.

Which WebSocket client library you choose will depend on your specific needs and preferences. If you are looking for a library that is easy to use and provides a number of features for building real-time applications, then Socket.IO is a good choice. If you are looking for a lightweight library that provides more control over the WebSocket connection, then ws is a good choice. If you are building a React application, then React WebSocket is a good choice.

Here are some examples of how to use the WebSocket client libraries mentioned above in Next.js, React, or any other front-end framework:

**Socket.IO**

```javascript
import io from "socket.io-client";

const socket = io("http://localhost:3000");

socket.on("new_article", (article) => {
  // Display a notification with the title of the new article and a link to view it.
});
```

**ws**

```javascript
import WebSocket from "ws";

const socket = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:3000");

socket.onmessage = (event) => {
  // Handle the message received from the server.
};
```

**React WebSocket**

```javascript
import React from "react";
import ReactWebSocket from "react-websocket";

const App = () => {
  const [articles, setArticles] = useState([]);

  const onMessage = (message) => {
    setArticles((prevArticles) => [...prevArticles, message.data]);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Real-time Notifications</h1>
      <ul>
        {articles.map((article) => (
          <li key={article.id}>{article.title}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      <ReactWebSocket url="ws://localhost:3000" onMessage={onMessage} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

These are just a few examples of how to use WebSocket client libraries in Next.js, React, or any other front-end framework. The specific way you use them will depend on your specific needs and the library you choose.
