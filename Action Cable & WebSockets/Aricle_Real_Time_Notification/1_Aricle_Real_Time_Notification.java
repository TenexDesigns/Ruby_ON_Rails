To implement real-time notifications when a new article is published using Action Cable and have both your front-end clients (JavaScript and Flutter) subscribe to it, you need to have a back-end implementation on the server side (Ruby on Rails) and client-side implementations for both JavaScript and Flutter. Here's how you can achieve this with code samples:

**Server-Side (Ruby on Rails):**

1. **Setting Up Action Cable:**
   Ensure you have Action Cable set up in your Ruby on Rails application.

2. **Create an Action Cable Channel:**
   Create a new Action Cable channel named `ArticlesChannel` (if not already created) to handle the notifications.

   ```ruby
   # app/channels/articles_channel.rb

   class ArticlesChannel < ApplicationCable::Channel
     def subscribed
       stream_from "articles:new"
     end
   end
   ```

3. **Broadcast New Articles:**
   In your model (e.g., `Article`), trigger a broadcast when a new article is published. This code will broadcast the article information to the "articles:new" channel whenever an article is published.

   ```ruby
   # app/models/article.rb

   after_save :broadcast_new_article

   def broadcast_new_article
     if published? && saved_change_to_published_at?
       ActionCable.server.broadcast(
         "articles:new",
         new_article: self
       )
     end
   end
   ```

**Client-Side (JavaScript):**

1. **Subscribe to the Channel:**
   In your JavaScript client, subscribe to the "articles:new" channel using Action Cable and handle the received notifications.

   ```javascript
   // app/javascript/channels/articles_channel.js

   import consumer from "./consumer"

   consumer.subscriptions.create("ArticlesChannel", {
     received(data) {
       if (data.new_article) {
         // Handle the new article notification here
         console.log(data.new_article);
       }
     }
   });
   ```

   This JavaScript code listens for new articles published and logs the new article data to the console. You can customize the code to display a notification to users.

**Client-Side (Flutter):**

1. **Flutter WebSocket Client:**
   In your Flutter application, you'll need to use a WebSocket client library to connect to the WebSocket server.

   You can use packages like `web_socket_channel` to establish a WebSocket connection and listen for real-time notifications. Here's a sample Flutter code snippet using `web_socket_channel`:

   ```dart
   import 'package:web_socket_channel/io.dart';

   void connectToWebSocket() {
     final channel = IOWebSocketChannel.connect('wss://your-server-url.com/cable');

     channel.stream.listen((data) {
       // Handle the received data, which will be your new article notification
       print(data);
     });
   }
   ```

   Ensure to replace `'wss://your-server-url.com/cable'` with your actual WebSocket URL.

By following these steps, you can set up real-time notifications for new articles when they are published in your Ruby on Rails application using Action Cable. Your JavaScript and Flutter clients can subscribe to the WebSocket channel and receive notifications as new articles are created and published. You can further customize the client-side handling of notifications to display them to the user in your application.
