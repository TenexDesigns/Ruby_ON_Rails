In Rails, helpers are modules that allow you to encapsulate reusable code and make it available in your views.
Helpers provide a way to extract complex logic or repetitive code from views and keep them clean and focused on presentation.

To define a helper module in Rails, you can create a new file with the desired name in 
the app/helpers directory and define your module inside it.
For example, to create a helper module called StudentsHelper
you would create a file named students_helper.rb in the app/helpers directory.


# app/helpers/students_helper.rb
module StudentsHelper
  def full_name(student)
    "#{student.first_name} #{student.last_name}"
  end

  def formatted_email(student)
    mail_to student.email, student.email
  end
end

In this example, we define a StudentsHelper module with two helper methods: full_name and formatted_email. 
  The full_name method takes a student object and returns their full name by concatenating the first_name 
  and last_name attributes. The formatted_email method generates a mailto link for the students email.

To use the helper methods in your views, you can include the helper module in the
corresponding controller or in specific views where you need the functionality. 
Including the helper module will make the helper methods available in those views.

To include the helper module in a specific controller, you can use the helper method in the controller:


# app/controllers/students_controller.rb
class StudentsController < ApplicationController
  helper StudentsHelper

  # Controller actions
end

This will make the methods from the StudentsHelper module available in all views rendered by the StudentsController.

To include the helper module in a specific view, you can use the helper method directly in the view file:

# app/views/students/index.html.erb
<% helper StudentsHelper %>

<!-- View content -->
This will make the methods from the StudentsHelper module available only in the index.html.erb view.

By using helper modules, you can encapsulate common functionality, such as formatting or rendering data, 
and reuse it across multiple views. This promotes code reuse, maintainability,
and keeps your views focused on presentation concerns.

To create a helper in Rails to put some code functionality to be used in a view,
you can define a module and include it in your view. Here are the steps to create a helper in Rails:

Create a new file in the app/helpers directory and name it with the name of your helper followed
by _helper.rb. For example, if you want to create a helper for students, you would name the file students_helper.rb.
In the new file, define a module with the same name as the file.
For example, if you named the file students_helper.rb, you would define a module called StudentsHelper.
Define your helper methods inside the module.
For example, you might define a method called format_name that takes a student object and returns a formatted name string.

module StudentsHelper
  def format_name(student)
    "#{student.last_name}, #{student.first_name}"
  end
end

To use the helper method in a view, include the helper module in the view by calling the helper
method with the name of the helper module. For example, if you want to use the format_name method in a view,
you would include the StudentsHelper module like this:
  
<%# app/views/students/show.html.erb %>

<% helper StudentsHelper %>

<p><%= format_name(@student) %></p>
Here are some key points to keep in mind when working with helpers in Rails:

Helpers are used to extract complex logic out of the view so that you can organize your code better [3].
Helper methods are defined in modules and included in views [0] [5].
To create a new helper, create a new file in the app/helpers directory with the name of your helper followed by _helper.rb [0].
Define a module with the same name as the file and define your helper methods inside the module [0].

To use a helper method in a view, include the helper module in the view by calling the helper method with
the name of the helper module [0] [5].
In summary, helpers in Rails allow you to extract complex logic out of the view so that you can organize your code better.
To create a helper, define a module with your helper methods and include it in the view using the helper method.
