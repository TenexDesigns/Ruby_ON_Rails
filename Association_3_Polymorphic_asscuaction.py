Polymorphic associations in Ruby on Rails allow a model to belong to multiple other models,
which can be of different types. This is useful when you have a single association that can be associated with various models.
Polymorphic associations are implemented using a combination of foreign keys and type columns.

Heres an explanation of how polymorphic associations work and how to use them in Rails with code samples:

Lets consider an example where you have a Comment model that can be associated with either a Post or an Article. 
The same Comment model can be used for both types of records.

Database Schema:
In your database, youll need to add two columns to the comments table: commentable_id and commentable_type. 
  The commentable_id column stores the foreign key of the associated record, and the commentable_type column stores
  the type of the associated record.

Model Setup:
In your Rails application, set up the models and their associations as follows:

class Comment < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :commentable, polymorphic: true
end

class Post < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :comments, as: :commentable
end

class Article < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :comments, as: :commentable
end

In this example, the Comment model uses belongs_to :commentable, polymorphic: true to establish the polymorphic association.
    The Post and Article models use has_many :comments, as: :commentable to specify the inverse association.

Usage:
Now, you can create comments and associate them with either a Post or an Article. Here's how you can do it:

post = Post.find(1)
comment = post.comments.create(content: 'This is a comment on a post')

article = Article.find(1)
comment = article.comments.create(content: 'This is a comment on an article')
In this example, we create a comment on a Post and another comment on an Article.
The commentable_id column stores the ID of the associated record (e.g., post.id or article.id),
and the commentable_type column stores the class name of the associated record (e.g., 'Post' or 'Article').

Retrieving Associated Records:
To retrieve the associated records, you can use the commentable method on the Comment model. For example:


comment = Comment.find(1)
comment.commentable # Returns the associated record (Post or Article)
This will return either the associated Post or Article record based on the polymorphic association.

Polymorphic associations provide flexibility when a model needs to be associated with multiple other models.
They simplify the process of sharing common functionality between models and allow you to reuse code and database columns effectively.
