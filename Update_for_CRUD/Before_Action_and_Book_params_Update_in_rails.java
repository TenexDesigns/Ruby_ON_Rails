Certainly, let's clarify the usage of `before_action` and the `@book.update(book_params_update)` code in your controller:

### `before_action`:
`before_action` is a method in Rails that allows you to define filters to run before specific controller actions. In your controller, you've defined a `before_action` called `:find_book` to run before the `show`, `update`, and `destroy` actions. This means that before these actions are executed, the `find_book` method is called to find the book by its ID and set it as an instance variable `@book`. This is a way to centralize the common code for finding a book and reusing it in multiple actions.

### `@book.update(book_params_update)`:
In this line of code, `book_params_update` is indeed a method that returns a hash. This method, defined in your controller, is used to permit and process the parameters for updating the book. The line of code does the following:

1. `book_params_update` is called to generate a hash of permitted parameters based on the request.
2. This generated hash, containing the parameters you want to update (title, author, or both), is passed as an argument to the `update` method.

The `update` method of an ActiveRecord model in Rails takes a hash of attributes and updates the record with those attributes. By passing `book_params_update` to `@book.update`, you are telling Rails to update the `@book` instance with the attributes specified in the hash, allowing partial updates based on the parameters present in the request.

In summary, `before_action` is a filter that runs before specific actions to set up common variables or perform shared tasks. `@book.update(book_params_update)` is a way to update the `@book` instance with attributes provided in the `book_params_update` method, permitting partial updates based on the request parameters.
