Yes, the validation in your `Book` model could be causing this issue. The validation rules you've set up require both the `title` and `author` to be present and to have a length between 8 and 15 characters. 

When you try to partially update a book (for example, only updating the title), the `author` field is not included in the update parameters, so it's treated as `nil` during the validation check. This causes the validation to fail because the `author` field is required to be present according to your validation rules.

To fix this issue, you can modify your validation rules to only apply when creating a new book, not when updating an existing one. Here's how you can do it:

```ruby
class Book < ApplicationRecord
  validates :author, presence: true, length: { in: 8..15 }, on: :create
  validates :title, presence: true, length: { in: 8..15 }, on: :create
end
```

In the above code, the `on: :create` option makes the validation rules apply only when a new book is being created. This allows you to partially update a book without having to include both the `title` and `author` fields in the update parameters.

However, if you still want to validate the `title` and `author` fields when updating a book, but only when they are included in the update parameters, you can use conditional validation. Here's how you can do it:

```ruby
class Book < ApplicationRecord
  validates :author, presence: true, length: { in: 8..15 }, if: :author_provided?
  validates :title, presence: true, length: { in: 8..15 }, if: :title_provided?

  def author_provided?
    author.present?
  end

  def title_provided?
    title.present?
  end
end
```

In the above code, the `if: :author_provided?` and `if: :title_provided?` options make the validation rules apply only when the `author` and `title` fields are included in the update parameters. This allows you to partially update a book without having to include both the `title` and `author` fields in the update parameters, but still validates them when they are provided.
