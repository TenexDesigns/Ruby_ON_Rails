To allow for partial updates in your Rails application, you can use the `update` method as you originally mentioned. However, you need to make some adjustments in your code to handle partial updates more gracefully. Here's how you can modify your controller and update action:

```ruby
module V1
  class BooksController < ApplicationController
    before_action :find_book, only: [:show, :update, :destroy]

    # Existing index and create actions...

    def show
      render json: @book
    end

    def update
      if @book.update(book_params)
        render json: @book
      else
        render json: @book.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity
      end
    end

    # Existing destroy action...

    private

    def find_book
      @book = Book.find(params[:id])
    rescue ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound
      render json: { error: 'Book not found' }, status: :not_found
    end

    def book_params
      params.require(:book).permit(:title, :author)
    end
  end
end
```

In this code, you are using `params.require(:book).permit(:title, :author)` to permit both `:title` and `:author` for updates. However, to allow partial updates, you can modify the `book_params` method to permit these attributes conditionally based on the presence of the parameters in the request. Here's an example of how you can do that:

```ruby
def book_params
  permitted_params = {}
  permitted_params[:title] = params[:book][:title] if params.dig(:book, :title)
  permitted_params[:author] = params[:book][:author] if params.dig(:book, :author)
  permitted_params
end
```

This modification ensures that you only update the attributes that are provided in the request, allowing partial updates. If `params[:book][:title]` is present, it updates the `title`, and if `params[:book][:author]` is present, it updates the `author`. If both are present, it updates both.

With this change, you can send a request to update the book with only the attributes you want to change, and it won't make it mandatory to update both `title` and `author`.











THE DIG METHOD
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



In the context of the code `params[:book][:title] if params.dig(:book, :title)`, it's using the conditional (ternary) operator to check if the `:title` key exists within the `params[:book]` hash. If it does, it returns the value associated with `:title`; otherwise, it returns `nil`.

Here's a breakdown of how this works:

1. `params[:book]` is checking if there's a key `:book` in the `params` hash.
2. `params.dig(:book, :title)` is checking if there's a key `:title` within the `params[:book]` hash. The `dig` method is used to safely navigate nested hashes without causing errors if a key is missing.
3. If `params.dig(:book, :title)` finds a value for `:title`, it returns that value.
4. If `params.dig(:book, :title)` doesn't find a value (returns `nil`), then the entire expression `params[:book][:title] if params.dig(:book, :title)` returns `nil`.

So, in the context of this code, it effectively checks if the `:title` key exists within `params[:book]` and, if it does, retrieves its value. If it doesn't exist, it returns `nil`.

Here's a more explicit way to write it if you find the ternary operator version unclear:

```ruby
if params.dig(:book, :title)
  params[:book][:title]
else
  nil
end
```

This will produce the same result but with a more verbose structure.





  




THE DIG METHOD
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `dig` method is a built-in method in Ruby, and it can be called on objects that are hash-like, such as hashes and arrays. It's available as a core method for these data structures in Ruby 2.3 and later.

The purpose of the `dig` method is to safely access nested elements within nested structures (hashes or arrays) without raising errors if a key or index is missing. It returns `nil` if any intermediate step in the structure doesn't exist.

For example, if you have a nested hash, you can use `dig` to access a specific value:

```ruby
hash = { a: { b: { c: 42 } } }

value = hash.dig(:a, :b, :c) # This will be 42
```

If any of the keys in the nested structure are missing, the `dig` method gracefully returns `nil`:

```ruby
value = hash.dig(:x, :y, :z) # This will be nil
```

This makes it very useful when you're working with nested data structures and want to avoid raising exceptions due to missing keys or indices.






The dig method vs the present? methos
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The `dig` method and the `.present?` method have similar purposes, but they are used in slightly different contexts, and the behavior is not identical.

1. **`dig` Method:**
   - `dig` is used for safely navigating and accessing nested elements within hashes and arrays. It returns `nil` if any intermediate key or index is missing.
   - It's used to avoid errors when accessing potentially missing keys in nested data structures.
   - `dig` is available for both hashes and arrays.

Example:
```ruby
value = hash.dig(:a, :b, :c)
```

2. **`.present?` Method:**
   - `.present?` is a method used with objects like strings, arrays, and hashes to check if the object is non-empty. It returns `true` if the object has content and `false` if it's empty or `nil`.
   - It's primarily used for checking if an object has meaningful content.
   - `.present?` is not a method of hashes or arrays but rather an ActiveSupport method available in Ruby on Rails.

Example:
```ruby
params[:book][:title].present?
```

So, in your example:

```ruby
params[:book][:title] if params[:book][:title].present?
```

This code first checks if `params[:book][:title]` is non-empty (using `.present?`) and then returns it if it's non-empty. If it's empty or `nil`, it returns `nil`. This is different from the behavior of `dig`, which would return `nil` if any of the keys (`:book`, `:title`) in the nested structure were missing.
