To allow for partial updates in your Rails application, you can use the update method as you originally mentioned. However, you need to make some adjustments in your code to handle partial updates more gracefully.
  Here's how you can modify your controller and update action:


Modify the Book Model and the controller


----------------------------------------------------------------------------


class Book < ApplicationRecord
  validates :author, presence: true, length: { in: 8..15 }, on: :create
  validates :title, presence: true, length: { in: 8..15 }, on: :create

  validates :author,  length: { in: 8..15 }, if:-> { author.present? }, on: :update
  validates :title, length: { in: 8..15 }, if: -> { title.present? }, on: :update


end


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
module V1
  class BooksController < ApplicationController


    before_action :find_book, only: [:show, :update, :destroy]

    def show
      render json: @book
    end

    def update

      if @book.update(book_params_update)
        render json: @book
      else
        render json: @book.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity
      end
    end











      def index

        render json: Book.all
      end



      def create
      book= Book.new(book_params)

      if book.save
        render json: book, status: :created
      else
        render json: book.errors , status: :unprocessable_entity

      end

      end



      def destroy
      user = Book.find(params[:id])

      user.destroy!
      render json: { message: 'Book successfully deleted' }, status: :ok
      rescue
          render json: { error: 'Failed to delete Book ' }, status: :unprocessable_entity

      end



      private
      def book_params

        params.require(:book).permit(:title,:author)
      end

      def book_params_update
        permitted_params = {}
        permitted_params[:title] = params[:book][:title] if params.dig(:book, :title)
        permitted_params[:author] = params[:book][:author] if params.dig(:book, :author)
        permitted_params
      end



      def find_book
        @book = Book.find(params[:id])
      rescue ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound => e
        render json: { error: "Book not found: #{e.message}" }, status: :not_found

      end



  end

end

```

In this code, you are using `params.require(:book).permit(:title, :author)` to permit both `:title` and `:author` for updates. However, to allow partial updates, you can modify the `book_params` method to permit these attributes conditionally based on the presence of the parameters in the request. Here's an example of how you can do that:

```ruby
def book_params
  permitted_params = {}
  permitted_params[:title] = params[:book][:title] if params.dig(:book, :title)
  permitted_params[:author] = params[:book][:author] if params.dig(:book, :author)
  permitted_params
end
```

This modification ensures that you only update the attributes that are provided in the request, allowing partial updates. If `params[:book][:title]` is present, it updates the `title`, and if `params[:book][:author]` is present, it updates the `author`. If both are present, it updates both.

With this change, you can send a request to update the book with only the attributes you want to change, and it won't make it mandatory to update both `title` and `author`.

In the provided code, you are making adjustments to your Rails controller and model to allow for partial updates. This means you can send a request to update a `Book` object with only the attributes you want to change, rather than requiring all attributes to be present in the update request.

Here's a breakdown of the code changes and what they do:

1. **Model (`Book`) Changes**:

   You have made changes to the model's validations, specifically for the `:author` and `:title` attributes. You've added conditional validations that only apply during the `:update` context. These validations ensure that if an attribute is provided in the update request, it must meet the length criteria. If the attribute is not provided in the request, the validation is skipped. This is essential to allow partial updates:

   ```ruby
   validates :author, length: { in: 8..15 }, if: -> { author.present? }, on: :update
   validates :title, length: { in: 8..15 }, if: -> { title.present? }, on: :update
   ```

2. **Controller (`BooksController`) Changes**:

   - In the `update` action, you are using the `book_params_update` method to permit attributes based on their presence in the `params`:

     ```ruby
     def update
       if @book.update(book_params_update)
         render json: @book
       else
         render json: @book.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity
       end
     end
     ```

   - The `book_params_update` method is defined to conditionally permit `:title` and `:author` attributes based on their presence in the `params` using `params.dig(:book, :title)` and `params.dig(:book, :author)`:

     ```ruby
     def book_params_update
       permitted_params = {}
       permitted_params[:title] = params[:book][:title] if params.dig(:book, :title)
       permitted_params[:author] = params[:book][:author] if params.dig(:book, :author)
       permitted_params
     end
     ```

   - The `book_params` method, used for creating a new book, continues to permit both `:title` and `:author` without conditionals:

     ```ruby
     def book_params
       params.require(:book).permit(:title, :author)
     end
     ```

These changes in the controller and model allow you to perform partial updates on a `Book` object. If you send a request to update a book with only the attributes you want to change, it will update those attributes without requiring all attributes to be present in the request. This provides more flexibility when updating `Book` records in your Rails application.
  








THE DIG METHOD
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



In the context of the code `params[:book][:title] if params.dig(:book, :title)`, it's using the conditional (ternary) operator to check if the `:title` key exists within the `params[:book]` hash. If it does, it returns the value associated with `:title`; otherwise, it returns `nil`.

Here's a breakdown of how this works:

1. `params[:book]` is checking if there's a key `:book` in the `params` hash.
2. `params.dig(:book, :title)` is checking if there's a key `:title` within the `params[:book]` hash. The `dig` method is used to safely navigate nested hashes without causing errors if a key is missing.
3. If `params.dig(:book, :title)` finds a value for `:title`, it returns that value.
4. If `params.dig(:book, :title)` doesn't find a value (returns `nil`), then the entire expression `params[:book][:title] if params.dig(:book, :title)` returns `nil`.

So, in the context of this code, it effectively checks if the `:title` key exists within `params[:book]` and, if it does, retrieves its value. If it doesn't exist, it returns `nil`.

Here's a more explicit way to write it if you find the ternary operator version unclear:

```ruby
if params.dig(:book, :title)
  params[:book][:title]
else
  nil
end
```

This will produce the same result but with a more verbose structure.





  




THE DIG METHOD
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `dig` method is a built-in method in Ruby, and it can be called on objects that are hash-like, such as hashes and arrays. It's available as a core method for these data structures in Ruby 2.3 and later.

The purpose of the `dig` method is to safely access nested elements within nested structures (hashes or arrays) without raising errors if a key or index is missing. It returns `nil` if any intermediate step in the structure doesn't exist.

For example, if you have a nested hash, you can use `dig` to access a specific value:

```ruby
hash = { a: { b: { c: 42 } } }

value = hash.dig(:a, :b, :c) # This will be 42
```

If any of the keys in the nested structure are missing, the `dig` method gracefully returns `nil`:

```ruby
value = hash.dig(:x, :y, :z) # This will be nil
```

This makes it very useful when you're working with nested data structures and want to avoid raising exceptions due to missing keys or indices.






The dig method vs the present? methos
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The `dig` method and the `.present?` method have similar purposes, but they are used in slightly different contexts, and the behavior is not identical.

1. **`dig` Method:**
   - `dig` is used for safely navigating and accessing nested elements within hashes and arrays. It returns `nil` if any intermediate key or index is missing.
   - It's used to avoid errors when accessing potentially missing keys in nested data structures.
   - `dig` is available for both hashes and arrays.

Example:
```ruby
value = hash.dig(:a, :b, :c)
```

2. **`.present?` Method:**
   - `.present?` is a method used with objects like strings, arrays, and hashes to check if the object is non-empty. It returns `true` if the object has content and `false` if it's empty or `nil`.
   - It's primarily used for checking if an object has meaningful content.
   - `.present?` is not a method of hashes or arrays but rather an ActiveSupport method available in Ruby on Rails.

Example:
```ruby
params[:book][:title].present?
```

So, in your example:

```ruby
params[:book][:title] if params[:book][:title].present?
```

This code first checks if `params[:book][:title]` is non-empty (using `.present?`) and then returns it if it's non-empty. If it's empty or `nil`, it returns `nil`. This is different from the behavior of `dig`, which would return `nil` if any of the keys (`:book`, `:title`) in the nested structure were missing.
