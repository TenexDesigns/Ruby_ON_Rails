Ruby on Rails, often just called Rails, is an open-source web application framework written in Ruby. 
It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and provides a structured way to develop web applications.
Rails emphasizes convention over configuration, aiming to make web development more productive and efficient.

Here are some key aspects and features of Ruby on Rails:

MVC Architecture: Rails follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. Models represent the data and business logic, 
views handle the presentation and user interface, and controllers handle the application logic and interaction between models and views.

Convention over Configuration: Rails relies on a set of conventions that eliminate the need for extensive configuration. By following naming conventions for files, 
folders, and database tables, Rails can automatically infer and generate the necessary code.

DRY (Dont Repeat Yourself) Principle: Rails encourages code reuse and reduces duplication through the DRY principle. By providing a set of abstractions and helpers,
Rails enables developers to write less code and focus on application-specific logic.

Database Integration: Rails includes an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system called ActiveRecord. It simplifies database operations by providing 
an abstraction layer that allows developers to interact with the database using Ruby methods rather than writing SQL queries.

Gem Ecosystem: Ruby on Rails benefits from a vast ecosystem of open-source libraries and plugins called gems. Gems can be easily integrated into 
Rails applications to add additional functionality, such as authentication, file uploading, or API integrations.

Conventionally Structured Code: Rails enforces a directory structure that promotes organization and clarity. Models, views, controllers, 
and other application components are placed in their respective directories, making it easier to navigate and understand the codebase.

Integrated Testing Framework: Rails includes a testing framework called RSpec, which enables developers to write unit tests, functional tests,
and integration tests for their applications. Testing is an integral part of the Rails development workflow and helps ensure code quality and maintainability.

Rapid Development: Rails aims to boost developer productivity and enables rapid prototyping and development of web applications. With its scaffolding feature, 
Rails can automatically generate code for basic CRUD operations, saving time during the initial stages of application development.

Ruby on Rails has gained popularity for its developer-friendly nature, scalability, and community support. It is widely used for building a variety of web applications, 
from small startups to large-scale enterprise systems.
