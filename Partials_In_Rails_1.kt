Partials in Ruby on Rails allow you to extract reusable sections of code into separate files,
making your views more modular and easier to maintain.
They are useful for rendering common elements across multiple views or for breaking down complex views into smaller components. 
Heres an explanation of how to use partials in Rails with code samples:

Creating a Partial:
To create a partial, you can create a new file with a name starting with an underscore (_) in the app/views directory. 
For example, let's create a partial for displaying a student's information:

Create a new file _student_info.html.erb:

<p>Name: <%= student.name %></p>
<p>Email: <%= student.email %></p>
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Rendering a Partial:

To render a partial within a view, you can use the render method. 
There are several ways to render a partial, depending on the context and requirements.





Rendering a Partial within a View:

Lets say you want to render the _student_info partial within the show.html.erb view for a specific student:


<h1>Student Details</h1>
<%= render 'student_info', student: @student %>
In the above example, the render method is used to render the _student_info partial,
passing in the @student instance variable as the local variable student.






Passing Data to a Partial:

You can pass additional data to a partial by specifying local variables.


<%= render partial: 'student_info', locals: { student: @student, show_email: true } %>
In the above example, we pass two local variables to the _student_info partial: student and show_email.
These variables can be accessed within the partial as regular local variables.



Rendering a Collection of Partials:

You can also render a collection of partials, passing in a collection of objects to be iterated over.


<h1>All Students</h1>
<%= render partial: 'student_info', collection: @students %>
In this case, the render method is used with the partial option set to 'student_info' and the collection
option set to @students. Each student object in @students will be passed to the partial as a local variable 
named after the partial (e.g., student).




Using Partials with a Collection:

When rendering a partial for a collection, you can access each object in the collection using the
local variable specified in the as option.


<%= render partial: 'student_info', collection: @students, as: :student %>
In this case, each student object in the @students collection will be accessible within the partial as a local variable named student.

By utilizing partials in Rails, you can keep your views organized, reusable, and easy to maintain. 
They help in reducing code duplication and make it easier to manage complex view structures.

*********************************************************************************************************************************
Partials in Ruby on Rails are reusable pieces of code that can be used to break up large views into more manageable chunks. 
They are similar to functions in other programming languages, as they allow you to write a piece of code once and reuse 
it throughout your application. This helps you keep your code DRY (Dont Repeat Yourself) 
and makes it easier to maintain and modify. [3]

To render a partial as part of a view, you use the render method within the view.
For example, to render a file named _menu.html.erb at that point within the view being rendered,
you can use the following code:

<%= render "menu" %>
Note the leading underscore character: partials are named with a leading underscore to distinguish them 
from regular views, even though they are referred to without the underscore. This holds true even when 
youre pulling in a partial from another folder. For example:

<%= render "shared/menu" %>
That code will pull in the partial from app/views/shared/_menu.html.erb. [0]

If you want to keep your code simple and/or reuse a block of code in multiple files,
then you can store that code in an html.erb file called a partial. Create a file to store your code 
in and name it using the syntax: _partial.html.erb. In the file where you want to include the code from a partial, insert the tag:

<%= render partial "shared/partial" %>
Youâ€™ll see your page with the code from the partial included. [4]

Partials are a standard Rails way to extract a piece of template code to its own file. 
The partial then can be called (rendered) from other templates, helpers, or controllers.
Partial templates are HTML-centric, but they are not that great if you need to add some non-trivial logic. [7]

One way to use partials is to treat them as the equivalent of
subroutines: as a way to move details out of a view so that you can grasp whats going on more easily.
For example, you might have a view that looks like this:

<%= render "shared/ad_banner" %>
<h1>Products</h1>
<p>Here are a few of our fine products:</p>
...
<%= render "shared/footer" %>
Here, the _ad_banner.html.erb and _footer.html.erb partials could contain content that is shared by many
pages in your application. You dont need to see the details of these sections when youre concentrating on a particular page. [0]

Partials can also be used alongside helpers, which are simple Ruby functions that live inside a module. 
Helpers are ruby-centric and support any API style for passing parameters that is supported by your Ruby version,
including keyword arguments. However, helpers are global and not isolated from instance variables, 
which can make them less flexible than partials. [7]

Overall, partials are a powerful tool in Ruby on Rails that allow you to create more modular and maintainable code. 
By breaking up large views into smaller, reusable pieces, you can keep your code DRY and make it easier to maintain and modify

  Partials are a powerful feature in Ruby on Rails that allow you to break up your views into smaller, reusable components.
Heres an explanation of how to use them, along with some code samples:

Creating a Partial
To create a partial, you simply create a new file in the app/views directory with a name that starts 
with an underscore (_) and ends with the same file extension as your views (usually .html.erb).
For example, if you wanted to create a partial for a product list item, you might create a file called _product.html.erb.

In the partial file, you can include any HTML, ERB code, or helper methods that you would normally include in a view.
For example, heres a simple _product.html.erb partial:

<div class="product">
  <h2><%= product.name %></h2>
  <p><%= product.description %></p>
  <p><%= number_to_currency(product.price) %></p>
</div>
  
  
Rendering a Partial
To render a partial in a view, you use the render method and pass in the name of the partial as a string. 
For example, to render the _product.html.erb partial for a single product, you might use the following code:

<%= render partial: 'product', locals: { product: @product } %>
In this example, the render method is passed the name of the partial ('product') as a string,
and a local variable (product) is passed in using the locals option. The local variable can then be used in
the partial to display information about the product.

Rendering a Collection of Partials
You can also use partials to render a collection of items, such as a list of products. 
To do this, you pass the collection to the render method instead of a single item.
For example, to render a list of products, you might use the following code:

<%= render partial: 'product', collection: @products %>
In this example, the render method is passed the name of the partial ('product') and a collection
of products (@products). The partial will be rendered once for each item in the collection,
and the local variable (product) will be set to the current item in the collection.

Passing Data to a Partial
You can pass additional data to a partial using the locals option.
For example, if you wanted to add a "selected" class to the current product in a list, you might use the following code:

<%= render partial: 'product', collection: @products, locals: { selected_product: @selected_product } %>
In this example, the locals option is used to pass an additional local variable (selected_product) to the partial.
The variable can then be used in the partial to add the "selected" class to the current product.
